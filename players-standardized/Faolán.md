## **Characters**

### **Faolán**
## Faolán Overview
- Name: Faolán
- Number: 73
- Position: WR3 (Wide Receiver)
- Species: North American Red Squirrel
- Height: 4'9" (standing upright)
- Weight: 38 lbs (most of it pure kinetic energy)
- Personality: Hyper-loyal, unpredictable, sharp-witted, and constantly twitchy. Faolán is the kind of receiver who seems to glitch between frames—defenders lose track of him not because he’s faster than them, but because he seems to rewire space on the fly. He chatters to himself mid-play, whispers his own play calls under his breath, and will full-body hurl himself at a catch like it’s life-or-death.

## Appearance:

-    Short and nimble, reddish-orange fur with streaks of black.

-    Long bushy tail painted with green tips to match the team.

-    Custom gloves with tiny claw ports and a “little wolf” rune stitched in.

-    Eyes always darting. Never blinks during a play.

## Traits:

-    Chaos-in-motion: Impossible to scheme for. His route running is more jazz improv than structure, yet somehow he’s always open when Dex needs him.

-    Tree-launcher reflexes: Has a signature leaping twist-catch where he flips like he’s springing from tree branches.

-    Fierce loyalty: He’ll block for his teammates with all 38 lbs of determined squirrel fury and never quits on a play.

-    Energy sponge: Constantly snacking on dried fruit, nuts, or energy gel packs from his belt pouch.

-    Special teams wild card: Dangerous on punt returns when subbed in—bounces off tacklers like a pinball.

## Overview 2
Species: North American Red Squirrel
Position: Wide Receiver 3 (WR3)
Nickname: “Little Wolf” (based on the Irish meaning of his name)
Build: Small, wiry, and spring-loaded—about 4'9" standing upright, ~38 lbs
Vibe: Pure chaos-in-motion. He doesn’t “run” routes—he surges through them like a current glitching through trees.
Visual Features:

    Fur: Reddish-orange with streaks of black down the spine and tail

    Tail: Big, fluffy, and streaked with green-dyed tips—waves like a flag when he runs

    Eyes: Wide, darting, almost never blinking during play

    Ears: Tipped with little tufts of fur, often twitching in sync with his nerves

    Expression: Smirky. Always looks like he knows something the cornerback doesn’t.

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Green #73—stitched snug to avoid snagging on turf mid-twist

    Cleats: Micro-sized and ultra-light with grip pads molded for climbing—though he uses them to launch

    Gloves: Custom squirrel-grip gloves with tiny claw ports and ultra-flex fingers

    Flair Patch: An acorn outline, symbolizing cleverness, persistence, and explosive potential

    Wears his standard gear on-field—but off-field, he’s often seen with his beloved tactical nut-belt (which the team endlessly teases him for)

## Personality:

    Twitchy, talkative, fiercely loyal

    Snack goblin—has probably hidden protein bits inside the stadium walls

    Will absolutely sacrifice his small body for a diving grab

    Gets weird focus before games—mutters play sequences, shadowboxes imaginary defenders, sometimes climbs stuff

    Known to chirp at safeties mid-play

## Faolán’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A pouch labeled “Hi-Energy Mission Mix” stuffed with cashews, cranberries, and questionable seeds

        A cracked mirror with a sticky note reading “Look alive. Again.”

        A patch kit (bike repair? glove repair? nut-belt repair?)

        A mini whiteboard where he writes random defensive tells and weird riddles

        A photo of the team taped to the inside of the locker door—he’s circled himself with a marker and written “Speed Demon”

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey (#73), wrinkled, one sleeve inside-out, a little sticky

        Cleats hanging by the laces but knotted in a squirrelly over-under braid

        Helmet slightly askew on the hook, with a sticker that says “NO NUTS, NO GLORY”

        Shoulder pads with a bite mark on one strap (he says it was part of a pregame ritual)

        Tactical nut-belt hung like a trophy on the far side—off-limits to all

        A team lanyard looped through a carabiner holding a whistle, a dog tag, and a peanut shell painted gold

    Lower Compartment:

        Gloves laid flat, finger tips out—one pair with scratch marks, one “emergency” pair

        A worn notebook titled “Angles, Spins, & Escape Routes” with route trees, escape hatches, and climbing diagrams

        A stack of mint wrappers and a few paper clips

        A small pile of acorn caps in the corner—maybe 20 deep

        A single tiny flashlight with red cellophane over the lens (used for “sneaky mode”)

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: a simple acorn outline

        Quote scribbled in permanent marker:

            “And you think I’m nuts!?”

        A countdown tally for hurdles, jukes, and “straight-up vanishings”—with labels like “Slip Phase / Tree Mode”

        A doodle of himself body-slamming a Content Policies defender with the caption “CHAOS WORKS”

    Standard Issue:

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, jammed under his backup gloves like it’s hiding
