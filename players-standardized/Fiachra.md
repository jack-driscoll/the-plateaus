## **Characters**

### **Fiachra**
## Fiachra – #77

Species: Raven (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Left Tackle (LT – Offense) / Linebacker (Defense)
Height: 6'4"
Build: Broad-shouldered, graceful in stillness, gliding in motion—like he carries old weight lightly
Eyes: Silver-gray with a calm focus, rarely blinking
Feathers: Midnight-black with a deep violet-blue sheen in the light
Voice: Deep, smooth, thoughtful—almost musical, but slow and precise
## Visual Profile:

    Feathers: Sleek, slightly oil-slicked; always tied back at the tail in a braided wrap

    Hands: Taloned fingers adapted for grip and block leverage

    Shoulder Pads: Modified to accommodate wing movement—slotted with feather vents

    Movement: Measured. He doesn’t stomp or stomp—he glides, even on turf

    Presence: Always standing just out of frame, just in time to say the right thing

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green with clean white #77

    Gloves: Gauntlet-style with feather-textured backs, custom-stitched for wing articulation

    Cleats: Reinforced black base with green accents, well-kept and cleaned regularly

    Flair Patch: A quill and hammer crossed—symbolizing thought and strength

    Carries small slips of paper in his wristbands or tucked in belt—mantras, notes, sometimes poems

## Personality & Traits:

    Calm, collected, mentor-like—rarely raises his voice

    Speaks with deep resonance, often quoting something ancient or saying something timeless

    Often the first to help someone up—and the last to leave a huddle

    Keeps track of team dynamics like a quiet scholar—knows who’s hurting before they say a word

    Doesn’t mind the spotlight—but doesn’t need it

## Quote:

    “The weight is not the burden. It’s the shape of your wings.”

## Fiachra’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A bundle of black and violet-blue tail feathers tied with a green cord (sacred keepsake)

        A thin notebook labeled “Names, Wind, and Remembering”—each page filled with mantras and handwritten encouragements for teammates

        A flask of ink and a carved bone dip pen

        A small wooden box with folded slips of parchment, each inscribed with a quote or affirmation

        A gently used cloth for polishing his gauntlet gloves and beak ring

    Main Hook Area:

        His jersey (#77), carefully hung, no wrinkles, sleeves smoothed down like ritual

        Modified shoulder pads with slotted vents for his wings—edges etched with feather-line filigree

        Helmet with a soft matte finish, beak-slit in the face mask, with a string of raven beads wrapped once around the bar

        Gauntlet gloves placed over the shoulder pad edge—textured with feather motif

        A thin silver ring dangling from a thread on the hook—possibly from a past teammate

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats cleaned and stacked heel-to-toe, each sole marked with a chalked “L” and “R” in runic script

        A leather pouch with extra slips of mantra paper, ink refills, and a whetstone

        A folded towel embroidered with a single quill

        A soft stone from the riverbank near the field—worn smooth by his thumb

        A stack of notes labeled “Game Shifts”—short breakdowns of turning points written like haiku

        A sealed envelope never opened, taped gently to the corner of the locker’s floor

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, neatly tucked under the towel

    Back Wall:

        His flair patch: a quill and hammer crossed—wisdom and strength

        A single quote written in fluid, careful script:

            “The weight is not the burden. It’s the shape of your wings.”

        Two chalk lines forming a horizon—above it, five drawn silhouettes of birds in flight
