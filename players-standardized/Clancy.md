## **Characters**

### **Clancy**
## Clancy – #92 Overview

Species: Crocodile (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Defensive End (DE)
Height: 6'5"
Weight: 280 lbs
Build: Sleek and powerful—long-limbed, low center of gravity, armored but agile
Scales: Mottled green and gray with natural plating along the shoulders and tail base
Eyes: Golden-yellow with vertical pupils—reads plays like prey movements
Expression: Stoic, calculating. Smirks more than he smiles.
## Personality & Traits:

    Tactical and analytical—studies linemen like puzzles, not enemies

    Often quiet, but when he talks, it’s sharp and dry—“You set high. I set low. Now we both know.”

    Has a near-perfect memory for snap counts—coaches swear he’s psychic

    Doesn’t celebrate sacks. Just nods once, resets

    Gets mistaken for a silent bruiser—until he starts quoting books on leverage and warfare mid-practice

    Fights with controlled violence—“Efficiency is mercy in cleats.”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #92

    Pants: White with green side striping—he likes symmetry

    Cleats: Low-cut for explosiveness—mud often dried into the scales

    Gloves: Armored on the back, thin across the palms for grip and “feeling angles”

    Helmet: Modified vent design for jaw width and mouthguard intake

    Flair Patch: A spiraled tooth, symbolizing both rotation and bite

## Aura on the Field:

    Uncoils off the line like a trap spring—never overshoots the quarterback

    Plays best when it’s raining—team says he gets “swamp vision”

    Known for walking through huddles pre-snap just to throw off linemen’s rhythm

    Phan calls him “The Lurker” in practice

## Quote:

    “Armor is for the slow. I wear speed and teeth.”

## Clancy’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A dog-eared copy of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, marked with color-coded tabs and annotations

        A folding magnifier clipped to the book spine

        A jar of clay scraped from the edge of the practice field—labelled “Pressure Point”

        A small brass compass, tarnished but functional

        A roll of grip tape marked with measured increments and snap count scribbles

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #92, folded across the hanger’s top bar—creases aligned perfectly

        Shoulder pads with custom interior padding cut to preserve tail flexibility

        Helmet with vent mod slots and a jaw-guard lined with neoprene

        Gloves hung with palm-side out, taped with white lines showing angle preferences

            “Lean Right / Panic Step / Late Reset”

        A padded mouthguard case engraved with a spiral tooth design

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats placed heel-first, with turf residue still clinging between studs

        A folded resistance band knotted three times over—used and re-used
