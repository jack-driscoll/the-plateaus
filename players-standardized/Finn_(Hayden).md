## Background & Lore:

    A U.S. Marine Corps reservist—disciplined, silent, deeply self-motivated

    Often mistaken for younger due to his quiet demeanor and boyish face

    Communicates through action—snaps perfectly, blocks with flow, never brags

    Has a tendency to show up early and leave later than anyone else

    Keeps to himself, but prays before every game in a whispered voice only the turf hears

    Cian trusts him as a “silent engineer of motion”

## On the Field:

    His snaps are fast, clean, and never telegraphed

    Uses leverage and timing instead of raw weight

    Is the kind of center who studies opponents’ blink patterns

    Has an unshakable calm when facing nose tackles 50+ lbs heavier

    Communicates protections through subtle foot placement and shoulder shifts

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #2

    Pants: Camouflage-style compression beneath standard white—military pattern influence

    Cleats: Scuffed but methodical, re-laced before each quarter

    Gloves: Balanced—no frills, no flair, just grip

    Flair Patch: A copper compass rose, symbolizing grounded navigation and forward direction

## Quote:

    “A marine first, a Plateau second”
