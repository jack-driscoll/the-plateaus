## **Characters**

### **Oisín**
## Oisín

Species: Anthropomorphic Fawn (Red Deer lineage)
Role: Assistant Druid Healer / Medic-in-Training
Height: 3'9"
Weight: 47 lbs
Build: Petite, spry, and full of nervous energy—like a leaf quivering in morning breeze
Fur: Soft fawn-colored with white spots still visible, though he insists he's “growing out of them”
Eyes: Big, dark brown, and filled with wonder and mild panic
Expression: Earnest and bright—always trying his best, always watching Aidan
## Personality & Traits:

    Sweet, awkward, and deeply loyal to Aidan—thinks of him like a mentor, guardian, and big brother rolled into one

    Still learning the arts of healing—often fumbles tools or herbs but remembers everything later

    Wears a tiny apron full of poultices, moss packets, and bandages—usually not in the right order

    Has a Púca familiar named Faolán—a mischief-prone spirit that manifests as a wisp, crow, or fox depending on mood

    Known for asking deep questions at the worst possible times, like “What if pain is a teacher?” during a sprain wrap

## Field Duties:

    Assists Aidan with calming players post-hit, fetching supplies, and holding the incense lighter during pregame rituals

    Frequently spotted darting onto the field with a bandage pouch yelling, “Coming through!”

    Once tried to bless a player's cleats with tree sap and glitter. It... sort of worked?

    Keeps tiny illustrated flashcards in his apron with notes like “Knee = bendy hinge. Ice = peace cube.”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Wears a miniature green druid cloak with way too many pockets

    Carries a pouch with herbal chews (half are snacks)

    Has one cracked horn (barely visible)—calls it “my weather finder”

    Flair Patch: A sunrise peeking through antlers, stitched in soft gold and brown thread

    Always seen with his Puca familiar by his side.

## Quote:

    “I know I’m little, but I’m full of big things.”

## Oisín’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A small woven basket of acorns and clover tufts, some with smiley faces drawn on them

        A tin labeled “Nervous Chews (not snacks)”—half full, some chewed

        A folded druidic flashcard deck, held together with a green ribbon—cards read things like “Mend bone = wrap + quiet + willow”

        A glass terrarium jar with moss and a snail named “Sir Leafy”

        A soft pouch of juniper beads—he says they “keep the shakies away”

        A friendship bracelet made of yarn and field grass, clearly made by a teammate

    Main Hook Area:

        His miniature green druid cloak, with pockets hanging open and a few feathers caught in the hem

        A small apron of mismatched pouches, labeled “Wraps”, “Ouches”, and “Wait I forgot what this one is”

        A wooden charm tag etched with his name and a tiny deer hoofprint

        A canvas scroll of diagrams, half-drawn, of a “perfect sideline healing kit” (he’s on Version 6)

        A dangling keychain of miniature socks—no one knows why

        A printed-out photo of him and Aidan under a pine tree, slightly water-damaged

    Lower Compartment:

        A mini mortar and pestle set with petals still in it

        A jar of tiny sticks wrapped in twine—“blessing wands”

        A stuffed satchel with medical gauze, pine needles, and candy wrappers

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, folded awkwardly and jammed behind a towel

        A small feather-lined basket—clearly for Faolán to curl up in

        A glowing will-o’-wisp charm made from a stone, wire, and who-knows-what (still flickers sometimes)

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A sunrise peeking through antlers, embroidered in golden thread

        Chalk-scrawled quote:

            “I know I’m little, but I’m full of big things.”

        A drawing of him, Faolán, and Aidan holding hands—signed “Team Heal!”
