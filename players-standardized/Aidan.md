## Aidan – #N/A (Support Staff)

Species: Anthropomorphic Owl
Role: Druid Healer / Team Medic
Height: 5'10" (but perches higher when needed)
Wingspan: 6'4"
Eyes: Golden amber, luminous, with a stillness that unnerves rookies
Feathers: Mottled gray, white, and silver—tufted like a barn owl, silent in movement
Beak: Hooked and ivory-hued, polished with herbal oil
Expression: Wise and gentle, but occasionally haunting—he sees more than just injuries
## Personality & Traits:

    Speaks softly and poetically, often in riddles or metaphors

    Walks the sideline in quiet arcs, always with a pouch of dried herbs and healing stones

    Clocks every player’s breath rate without needing a monitor

    Known to appear beside injured teammates before anyone calls him—he just knows

    Carries a faint herbal scent—lavender, spruce, and something older

    Wears a long druidic cloak with woven sigils, over a modified trainer’s belt and field bag

    Close bond with Oisín, his little fawn assistant, and Faolán, who calls him “Doc Owl”

## On the Sideline:

    Performs pre-game rituals with incense and whispered blessings to the earth

    Uses a blend of modern sports medicine and ancient woodland remedies

    Can stabilize a twisted knee with just pressure and breath—then follows it with tape

    Sometimes “owl-nods”—a silent gesture the team has come to respect deeply

## Uniform & Gear:

    No jersey—wears a cloak with druidic knotwork, fastened with a green-stone clasp

    Carries a medic pouch lined with soft moss, dried flowers, bandages, and balm

    Has feathered gauntlets with woven sigils in thread that shifts color in moonlight

    Flair Patch: A triskelion wrapped in feathered vines, symbolizing healing through motion, memory, and nature

## Quote:

    “There is no wound that does not speak.”

    Top Shelf:

        A small wooden box of dried herbs (lavender, willow bark, meadowsweet)

        A bundle of owl feathers, bound with copper thread—not his own

        A hand-labeled tin of feather wax and polish

        A slender glass vial of forest water, with a floating clover sprig inside

        A folded page from an old herbal codex, edges burned but protected in laminate

        A tin of “Wingroot Salve”—used for joints and calming nerves

    Main Hook Area:

        His druidic cloak, hung on a carved wooden hanger, sigils embroidered in three rings

        A modified trainer’s field belt, with pouches labeled “Wraps”, “Poultice”, and “Wards”

        A length of twined rope made from cedar bark, used in binding rituals and field repairs

        A loop of dried flowers—always seasonal, always refreshed weekly

        His gloves, fingerless and textured with spiral stitching

        A small leather satchel of stones, each with a unique sigil carved into them

    Lower Compartment:

        A rolled green towel, scented with pine and lavender

        A carved wooden bowl, used in rituals for pre-game focus or quiet mourning

        A box of chalks and binding thread in six earthen tones

        A collection of vintage field medics’ notes, some handwritten, some photocopied

        A polished stone mortar and pestle

        A carefully folded vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, placed with respect alongside a cedarwood sachet

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A triskelion wrapped in feathered vines, embroidered in emerald and ash threads

        Quote written in charcoal dust and gently sealed with resin:

            “There is no wound that does not speak.”

        A faint painted circle of feathers, like a nest, surrounds the quote
