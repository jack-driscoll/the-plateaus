## **Characters**

### **Schlitz**
## Schlitz – #81 Overview

Species: Fox (Red Fox)
Position: Tight End (TE)
Height: 6'1"
Weight: 197 lbs
Build: Lean but deceptively strong—wiry muscle with a spring in his step
Age: 22
## Visual Profile:

    Fur: Rust-red with black legs and a white-tipped tail

    Eyes: Gold, sharp, always scanning—he looks like he’s thinking three moves ahead

    Ears: Perked high and twitching—he hears audibles before they’re called

    Face: Has a permanent half-smirk—cocky, but not cruel

    Tail: Flashes behind him as he runs routes like punctuation

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Green #81, always rolled tight at the waist, tail sticking out clean

    Gloves: Slate-gray with extra tack on the palms—designed for one-paw snags

    Cleats: Low-profile with extra toe flex for those tight cuts

    Pads: Custom-trimmed for freedom of movement; he hates bulk

    Flair Patch: A sly fox silhouette wrapped in a spiral arrow—“Strike when you curl”

## Personality:

    Talks trash, but in clever riddles

    Always has snacks, but never shares (unless it’s to mess with Faolán)

    Doesn’t mind blocking, but loves slipping through the seam for surprise grabs

    Likes to “disappear” for a couple reps during practice, then reappear with a ridiculous catch

    Claims he once outfoxed a coverage scheme by whispering at the linebacker

## Quote:

    “I never run the same route twice. I just trick you into thinking I did.”
