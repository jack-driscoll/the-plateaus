## **Characters**

### **Sprocket**
## Sprocket

Species: Raccoon (Anthropomorphic)
Role: Equipment Manager, sideline strategist, multitool of mayhem
Height: 4'11"
Weight: 84 lbs
Build: Scrappy, wiry, fast-twitch kinetic energy bundled in a hoodie
Fur: Dark charcoal with gray markings, tail always swaying like it’s clocking time
Eyes: Electric amber, constantly scanning, calculating gear-to-grit ratios
Expression: Sharp grin, grease-smudged forehead, and goggles perched above his brow
## Personality & Traits:

    Tactical genius of gear logistics—knows where every piece of tape, cleat, and chinstrap lives

    Talks faster than most people think

    Refers to himself as “Chief Operations Officer, Field-Ready Division”—but never with a straight face

    Has at least three tools in his pockets at all times

    Keeps a weatherproof field binder with repair contingencies for helmets, cleats, and sudden fires

    Teammates swear he once fixed a cracked facemask with a paperclip and sheer will mid-game

## Special Skills:

    Can lace a cleat in five seconds flat

    Modified the team’s ball pump to double as a sideline pressure gauge and radio scanner

    Installed secret pouches in multiple players' lockers—“don’t ask which ones”

    Rides a gas-powered scooter around the practice field named “Gritwheel”

    Carries a slingshot. Hasn’t said why.

## Uniform & Gear:

    Usually seen in a Plateaus green utility hoodie with way too many pockets

    Wears a custom tool belt, part mechanic, part wizard

    Fingerless gloves, cut from an old pair of Dex’s discarded ones

    Flair Patch: A gear surrounded by stars, symbolizing problem-solving and midnight breakthroughs

    Favorite saying when something breaks:

        “Give me ten seconds, a zip tie, and belief.”

## Quote:

    “It’s not broken. It’s just dramatically improvising.”

## Sprocket’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A dented tin labeled “Emergency Solutions (Tier 2)”—contains zip ties, an old whistle, and a multi-tool with half the bits missing

        A laminated field diagram with notes scrawled in four colors of dry-erase marker

        A half-eaten protein bar wedged inside a repurposed mouthguard case

        A beat-up walkie-talkie, covered in duct tape with the name “GRITCOM” sharpied on the side

        A tiny solar-powered fan, clipped onto the shelf with a bent binder clip

    Main Hook Area:

        A child-sized Plateaus green hoodie, sleeves scorched at the cuffs, tool loops stitched into the hem

        A custom tool belt hanging from a hanger like sacred armor

        Goggles dangling by one earstrap, permanently fogged on one side

        Fingerless gloves, patched with mismatched scraps from other players’ gear

        A dangling pouch labeled “Triage Tape”—contents unknown

        A lanyard with five mini-wrenches, a safety pin medallion, and one coin from an arcade that shut down in 2009

    Lower Compartment:

        A socket wrench wedged into the drain channel like it lives there

        A small rubber duck wearing a Plateaus helmet—name tag: “Brigadier”

        A metal case with emergency helmet clips, boot spikes, and two lighters (neither working)

        A mess of jumbled shoelaces, most frayed, some tied together

        A team-issued Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, unopened, stuffed behind a rag

        A tiny cooler labeled “DO NOT TOUCH (unless halftime)”—contents mysterious

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A gear surrounded by stars, sharp-stitched with reflective thread

        Quote scratched in jagged stylus lines:

            “It’s not broken. It’s just dramatically improvising.”

        Below that: a tally marked “field fixes without tools” – at least 27 and counting
## The Owners: Family Ted & The Italians

## 🕶️ THE OWNERS OF THE PLATEAUS
## 🧔 Family Ted

“Strategy is just grit in disguise.”
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always wears aviators indoors, regardless of weather or lighting

    Smells permanently of pipe smoke and barbecue sauce

    Dresses like your favorite uncle if he was also running covert ops from a golf course

    Owns 49% of the Plateaus, but insists it’s “a clean 51”

    Hair slicked back, voice like gravel on velvet

    Sometimes wears a “World’s Okayest Executive” hoodie that no one remembers printing

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    Mob consigliere energy + Sunday dad warmth + late-night conspiracy podcast host

    Believes the playbook should be carved into wood, not uploaded to “cloudspace”

    Has never once opened a spreadsheet

    Known to appear in the locker room post-win, lean against a doorway, and say:

        “That’s the kind of grit you can’t fake, boys.”

## 🗝️ Rumors & Legacy:

    May have once taken a penalty kick with a glass of bourbon in his other hand

    Has never been photographed with his mouth fully open

    Claims the stadium is built on “good ley lines”

    When players ask for contract bonuses, he offers cryptic riddles and brisket

## 🍝 The Italians

Three men. Three tracksuits. One unknowable force.
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always appear in a group of three

    Wear matching tracksuits in varying shades of navy blue, never labeled

    Never speak aloud—they just nod… and things happen

    One is always eating something:

        Olives, biscotti, prosciutto, or a peeled pear

    No one knows their names.

    No one knows where they’re from.

    They don’t know either.

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    The quiet engine room of Plateaus operations

    Appear randomly at practice, games, locker room corners—always just watching

    Never interfere, but somehow every stadium upgrade, locker repair, or glove shipment?

        “Handled by the Italians.”

    Sit in the owner’s booth at Tremethor Stadium—glass so dark it looks like a void

        Players sometimes say they feel watched… but comforted, somehow

## 🕰️ Rumors & Lore:

    One of them once adjusted a chinstrap, and the player never fumbled again

    Have been seen standing in the rain, unmoving, as if waiting for a storm to speak

    Jack’D has a photo of them in his equipment room, half-blurred like it glitched reality

    That photo is taped under the words:

        “Don’t ask.”

## 🔮 Collective Influence:

Family Ted brings the chaos and charm.
The Italians bring the silence and certainty.
Together, they own the Plateaus in spirit, deed… and probably ancient contract written in something that glows under moonlight.

Want a visual of them next? Maybe just… half-visible through the glass of that owner’s booth?
