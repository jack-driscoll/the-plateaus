## Dex’s Locker Layout:

    Top Shelf:

        A folded green hoodie with his QR code showing on the shoulder

        A small bundle of sage and pine needles wrapped in twine (burnt edges—used often)

        A Polaroid of the team post-practice, sweat-soaked and laughing, pinned with a safety clip

        An old key—no one knows what it opens

        His jersey, neatly hung and unwrinkled

        Cleats hanging by the laces—perfectly aligned soles

        Towel draped in a perfect triangle fold

        A small green thread tied to the loop (gift from someone—maybe Phan?)

    Lower Compartment:

        Football, worn smooth on one side

        Slate gray gloves laid palm-up, revealing his totem patch stitched inside the cuff

        Spiral notebook with scuffed cover labeled: “Reads / Signals / Dreams”

        A miniature wooden deer carved from driftwood (maybe made by Sprocket?)

    Back Wall of Locker:

        His personal sigil—not yet revealed—drawn in faint white chalk

        A motivational quote taped up, handwritten in sharpie:

            "Lead the charge. But hear the wind."
