### **Lommán**
## Lommán – #66

Species: Human
Position: Left Guard (LG)
Height: 6'3"
Weight: 295 lbs
Build: Broad-shouldered and thistle-tough—leaner than most guards, but planted like a tree
Hair: Golden-blond, swept back with curls that catch sunlight and sweat
Eyes: Gray-green, like distant mist over wet stone
Skin: Fair with weathered freckling on his arms and shoulders
Expression: Open, serene—like he’s always listening to something deeper than the huddle
## Personality & Traits:

    Known as the Meadow Man among teammates

    Quiet, poetic, steady—he listens more than he speaks, but what he says matters

    Often brings dried herbs or folded leaves to meetings—“for scent memory,” he says

    A lover of wide-open spaces—runs barefoot in morning dew before game days

    Has an almost mythical ability to find calm in pre-snap chaos

    Once blocked an all-blitz front with his eyes closed (claimed it helped “see the root of force”)

## On the Field:

    Left guard with unshakable balance and surprising burst

    Doesn't overpower—he redirects, like a stone in a stream

    Known to hum low Irish airs between plays—says it keeps him breathing

    Will occasionally quote poetry in the huddle if things get too tense

    Phan calls him “the soft earthquake”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #66, loose in the arms but cinched tight at the waist

    Pants: Slightly grass-stained from kneeling during silent meditations

    Gloves: Lined with linen—he stitched them himself for “grounding”

    Flair Patch: A moonlit clearing, with a single standing stone at its center

## Quote:

    “Strength without stillness is just noise.”

## Lommán’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A folded linen cloth with embroidered knotwork and dirt-smudged corners

        A leather journal tied with twine—inside: sketches of line stances and wildflowers

        A pouch labeled “Field Spirits” containing tiny stones, moss, and a lark feather

        A rolled herbal salve stick labeled “Still Strength”

        A stub of beeswax candle and a match tucked in wax paper

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #66 draped with quiet intent, folds even and natural

        Shoulder pads not stacked, but leaned to the side on the bottom

        Helmet with hand-etched spirals inside—no visor, only a dangling feather charm

        Gloves lined with linen wraps, slightly stained with soil

        A single branch of dried yew, bound to the hook with jute cord

        A soft cotton strip hung with pressed ferns stitched into the edge

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats wiped clean but never polished, laces replaced with woven hemp cord

        A small flat stone he sits on before games, initials “L.M.” etched with fingernail

        A pouch of loose chalk dust and powdered sage

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, folded into a cloth napkin alongside his cup

        A leather wrap labeled “Recovery Roots”—inside: cooling balm, thistle oil, and a handwritten note from a sibling

        A dried daisy tucked behind a bottle of muscle rub

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A moonlit clearing with a standing stone—stitched in soft gray and earth green

        Quote drawn faintly in chalk, sloping like a hillside:

            “Strength without stillness is just noise.”
