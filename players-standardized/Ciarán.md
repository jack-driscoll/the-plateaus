## **Characters**

### **Ciarán**
## Ciarán – #42

Species: Human
Position: Holder (special teams)
Age: 21
Height: 5'4"
Weight: 142
Build: Slender, agile, and often underestimated
Hair: Dark black, straight, and cleanly parted—sometimes tucked behind his ears
Eyes: Soft brown, observant, often scanning without drawing attention
Skin: Fair with a slight olive undertone
Expression: Focused but approachable—gives off quiet competence with just a glance
Vibe:

    Constantly mistaken for being younger—every team photo he gets called “the kid” even though he’s not the youngest

    Doesn’t care about spotlight, only about execution

    Carries himself like someone who knows he’s important but doesn’t need to prove it

    Speaks with precision—never rambles

    Often the one holding the camera for team group shots (but rarely in them)

On the Field:

    Hands like clamps, barely visible motion when placing the hold

    Known for calming kickers—even Juno once nodded in approval and said “He centers the moment”

    Stays warm by doing single-leg balance drills on the sideline

    Can read wind like a weather mage—his subtle repositionings have saved more kicks than most realize

Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Green #42, fitted clean but always with one cuff rolled up

    Cleats: Worn but well-loved—he doesn’t replace them until absolutely necessary

    Gloves: Tighter than most, with thumb grooves carved in for ball feel

    Flair Patch: A spinning coin, symbolizing precision, timing, and clutch decisions under pressure

Quote:

    “You don’t get credit for holds. You just get remembered for misses.”

## Ciarán’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A hard-shell glasses case (empty—he just keeps it there)

        A folded microfiber cloth for cleaning visors and tape marks

        A small tin labeled “Grip Wax – Quiet Hands”

        A laminated printout of kicker timing splits—each row color-coded

        A well-worn paperback of “Finite and Infinite Games" with index notes

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #42 hung with precision, left sleeve slightly rolled

        Shoulder pads tightly clipped and centered

        Helmet with a coin decal on the back panel

        Gloves clipped together with a binder ring—thumb grooves smoothed with wear

        Cleats resting under the hook, scrubbed but frayed around the laces

        A small index card taped to the inside of the door reading:

            “Hold. Spin. Laces. Peace.”

    Lower Compartment:

        A spare wristband with “Don’t blink” written in pen

        A ziplock of cue cards with wind patterns, practice times, and kicker preferences

        A mini whiteboard and marker set

        A small timer stopwatch with duct tape over the beeper

        Shock Doctor jock and cup, neatly set in its own mesh pouch—he prefers this over the Bike

        A folded towel marked with faint turf smears from knee holds

        A backup pair of gloves and a mint tin labeled “focus”

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: A spinning coin—etched and reflective

        Quote printed in neat black marker:

            “This is a finite game, a we're gonna win it game."

        A tiny circle drawn with chalk where he sometimes presses his thumb before heading out
