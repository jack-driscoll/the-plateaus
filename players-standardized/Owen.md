### **Owen**
## Owen – #75

Species: Black Bear (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Left Tackle (LT)
Height: 6'6"
Weight: 345 lbs
Build: Massive and grounded—built like a mountain with arms that move like trees
Fur: Deep black, thick and matted at the shoulders, often dusted with chalk or turf
Eyes: Warm amber, steady and unshakable
Expression: Quiet strength—rarely speaks, but when he does, people listen
## Personality & Traits:

    The older twin (by 12 minutes, as he’ll occasionally remind you with a grin)

    Calm, contemplative, and extremely hard to rattle

    Known for protecting Dex’s blindside like it’s sacred

    Treats every down like a ceremony—tightens his gloves the same way before every snap

    Offers quiet wisdom in one-liners: “Anchor low.” “Let him feel your breath.”

    Looks slow off the line… until the defender disappears under him

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #75

    Pants: White football pants (clean but stretched tight across the thighs)

    Gloves: Heavy-duty lineman gloves with grip pads and reinforced backs

    Tape: Thick green athletic tape around the wrists, etched with druidic patterns

    Cleats: Reinforced with extra stud pressure for trench traction

    Flair Patch: A yew tree silhouette wrapped in a circle—roots and branches intertwined

## Aura on the Field:

    Makes no noise at the line. He just exists there.

    Opponents often think he’s slow—until they bounce off him like wind off a cliff

    The younger players on the team say standing next to him makes them feel “safe”

    Dex once called him “our great wall of breath and brawn”

## Quote:

    “Nothing moves unless I let it.”

## Owen’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A folded green towel, edges singed slightly at the corners

        A clay totem of a yew tree with roots curled into a spiral

        A corked bottle filled with soil from his family’s forest grove

        A handwritten note from Coach Cian: “Strongest don’t break. They hold.”

        A tiny wooden block etched with an old Irish blessing, worn smooth by paw

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #75, folded over the hook in precise thirds

        Shoulder pads wide as a doorway, scuffed from years of trench battles

        Helmet with a dull finish and no decals—just the faint impression of claw scratches

        Cleats set beneath the pads, thick-soled and squared like hooves

        Wrist tape rolls with etched druidic patterns, stacked three high

        A cloth strip tied like a vine around the inside of the locker handle—quiet ritual

    Lower Compartment:

        Heavy-duty lineman gloves, palms worn but still intact

        A small leather-bound notebook with line calls and ancient runes jotted in the margins

        A sharpening stone and a metal hand mirror

        A tin labeled “Sap & Salt” (contents unknown)

        A 1980s Bike University jock, unwashed since college—wrapped in a folded green undershirt like a relic

        A small pouch with clippings of turf and pebbles from rival stadiums—trophies in his own way

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: A yew tree silhouette, roots and branches circled

        Quote etched into the paint in slow, deliberate strokes:

            “Nothing moves unless I let it.”
