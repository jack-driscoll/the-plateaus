## **Characters**

### **Iud**
## Iud – #7

Species: Otter (Anthropomorphic)
## Position(s):

    Offensive Line (rotating interior lineman)

    Cornerback (CB) on defense in specific packages—surprisingly agile for a lineman
    Height: 5'11"
    Weight: 150 lbs
    Fur: Sleek brown with a soft gloss when damp; lighter fur under the jaw and along the chest
    Eyes: Cool sea-gray, darting but serene
    Expression: Dreamy or distant when idle—sharp and calculating the moment the play begins

## Personality & Traits:

    Mystical and eccentric—frequently quotes philosophers, mystics, and wild nature facts

    Known to meditate in the cold plunge or float silently in the team pool for “clarity”

    Described by Caolán as “the most river-spirit being I’ve ever blocked next to”

    Plays like water under pressure—slips past blocks or surges through them with misdirection

    Curious to a fault—asks odd questions in film study like:

        “What would this play sound like if it were a waterfall?”

## On the Field:

    On offense: Uses subtle, flowing movement and misleading posture to redirect defenders

    On defense: Nimble enough to drop into tight coverage—deceptively fast

    Wears wrist tape covered in glyphs and runes, some real, some invented

    Known for “ottering out”—suddenly slipping under a bigger player and popping up with the ball

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #7, worn snug to the body for hydrodynamics

    Gloves: Flexible, slightly tacky; covered in contour-line etchings

    Cleats: Mid-profile, often soaked from pregame rituals

    Flair Patch: A looped wave spiral, representing fluidity, adaptation, and trickster wisdom

## Quote:

    “I flow where I’m needed.”

## Iud’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A bundle of sea-smoothed driftwood, wrapped in jute twine

        A tin of beeswax salve labeled “Clarity Blend – for hands and halos”

        A folded map of a local stream, hand-annotated with water speed notes

        A small jar of polished river stones, each with a faint sigil or initial carved in

        A weathered paperback of The Cloud of Unknowing, bookmarked with dried kelp

        A half-melted soy candle in a sea glass holder

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #7 hung like a prayer flag—slightly askew, collar stretched out

        Shoulder pads with carved notches on one edge—unexplained but counted

        Helmet with small water droplet decals along the rear edge

        Gloves hanging by their pinky loops, chalked with wavelike contour patterns

        A cord of knotted thread hanging down the side, with tiny bells woven in

        A drawing of a whirlpool taped to the inside of the door, signed “Iud – dreaming”

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats still wet from a solo river ritual that morning

        A sloshing mason jar with two pebbles inside—he calls it “practice patience”

        A cloth pouch with wrist wraps bearing stitched spirals and cloud symbols

        A small, carved wooden otter figurine laying on its back—possibly hand-made

        A seaweed-wrapped stick of incense

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, coiled like a ritual belt with a looped shell tucked inside

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: A looped wave spiral—etched faintly into brushed metal

        Quote scratched softly into the wall beneath it:

            “I flow where I’m needed.”

        Three concentric water rings drawn in blue chalk, like ripples from a single drop
