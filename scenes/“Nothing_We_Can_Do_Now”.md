“Nothing We Can Do Now”
A locker room. A glint. A rupture.
It started with a clink — the subtle sound of a small, shattered thing shifting beneath the bench. Fintan was the one who found it: a half-melted glass stem, blackened at one end. Not a vape. Not a prank. The kind of thing that told a different story entirely.
Phan was already moving. "Get Aidan," he said, without raising his voice. Ciaran nodded. Sean hadn’t shown up for warmups. His pads were still hanging in his locker, clean. Untouched.
That’s when the door slammed open.
The Content Policies stormed in.
Steel-blue uniforms. Clipboard visors. QR-gloved hands gripping enforcement batons. Their leader — Cease — pointed to the locker.
“Violation of morality clause 17-b,” they announced, monotone. “Unfit narrative. Harmful depiction. Immediate intervention.”
An aide — sweet Oisín, barely past three feet — was shoved to the floor trying to explain. Faolán bared his teeth. Dex started forward, fists clenched.
But it was too late.
They dragged Sean out before the team could say anything — arms pinched behind his back, eyes hollow, his cleats still untied.
“Well, I guess there’s nothing we can do to help Sean now,” Speedy said bitterly, voice low.
“I was ready,” Sean called out as they pulled him through the doors. His voice cracked, but it still carried. “I was completely ready to be supported and aided by my teammates until this ruthless block by The Content Policies.”
Silence.
“I guess I’ll go back to hiding my drug use,” he said, louder now. “And pretending everything is alright while my life falls apart because of these antiquated puritan values.”
The door slammed behind him. The room stood still. Even Faolán, who normally glowed in moments of rebellion, looked dimmed.
