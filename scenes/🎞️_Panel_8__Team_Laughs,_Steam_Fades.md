🎞️ Panel 8: Team Laughs, Steam Fades
Group shot: Jack smirking, Ethan still posing, Schlitz pointing and laughing, Dex half-smiling, Finn blissed out.
Lighting: Slightly cooler, steam rising
Caption: Game 3 may be over… but the afterglow? Legendary.

SEASON ARC IDEAS
1. The Narcs' Dirty Tactics
The Narcs are slick, smug, and always just on the edge of the rulebook. They wear sharp navy and silver uniforms.
Rumors swirl that they’re juicing their players with banned tech-enhanced pads—Phan's especially suspicious.
There’s an infamous game where the lights go out mid-play… and the Narcs somehow come out ahead. 🤨
2. Dex’s Injury & Recovery
Early in the season, Dex takes a brutal hit—maybe from the Narcs’ snarling linebacker, a wolf named Vex.
He spends two games benched, morale dips, and that’s when “The Inspiration of Game 7” happens.
3. The New Recruit
A mysterious, super-fast jackrabbit named Zip joins mid-season.
Nobody trusts him at first (he used to train with the Narcs), but he proves himself with a game-winning sprint across 97 yards.
4. Phan’s Moment
Phan usually plays it cool in the background, but in Game 5, Dex is triple-covered, and Phan pulls off a dazzling one-pawed catch in the end zone.
It becomes a viral moment: “THE PHAN-TOM SNAP.”
5. Tromethor Showdown
Final game at Tromethor Stadium. It’s dark, rainy, the crowd is roaring.
The Narcs are ahead. Dex calls an audible—a trick play they haven’t dared run all season.
Time slows. The Plateaus rise.

💥 CHARACTER IDEAS
Coach Bristle – A grizzled old bear who only speaks in quotes from historical battles.
Sprocket – The raccoon equipment manager who’s always tweaking stuff illegally but only to help.
Juno – A badass gazelle kicker with sniper-like aim and no time for nonsense.

Wanna dive deeper into a particular game, design a rival character, or make mockups of the Narcs? I’m so here for it, quarterback 🐺🦌

Title: "Acorn Tactical"
Steam rolls through the Plateaus' locker room as the team peels off practice gear, laughter echoing off the tile. Faolán scampers in late, fur still fluffed up from wind sprints, wearing nothing but compression shorts, cleats, and—of course—his off-field pride and joy: the tactical nut-belt.
It’s olive drab with modular pouches. One holds cashews. One almonds. A secret compartment hides dried cranberries. There's even a mini tin labeled “Mission Mix.”
Jack’D, toweling his mohawk dry, catches sight of it and smirks.
“Faolán, you prepping for war or snack time?”
Schlitz leans over from his locker with a mock-serious nod. “What’s your MRE loadout today—Operation Salted Caramel?”
Phan snorts from across the room. “Bro’s got a chest rig for pistachios.”
The team erupts in laughter. Faolán stands there, arms crossed, munching silently on a pecan he pulled from a Velcro pouch. He narrows one eye, shrugs, then tosses the rest of the pecan high in the air, backflips, and catches it in his mouth mid-spin.
Dex grins. “Leave him alone. You’ll be thanking that belt when he saves your sorry tails with squirrel fuel in the 4th.”
Faolán just gives a smug tail flick, adjusts the belt like a samurai retying his obi, and chirps:
“Chaos needs calories, boys.”
The acorn patch on his locker glints in the fluorescent light.
LUPA (over headset, calm and low): “Rolling it back. Game 2, final drive. Clock at 1:32. Plateaus down by six.”

Title: "Acorn Protocol Activated"
The Plateaus are backed up on their own 35. Dex wipes sweat from his antlers, eyes scanning the Narcs' smug secondary.
“Trips left. Faolán, you're the ghost,” he mutters.
Faolán nods, already vibrating at a frequency only bats and chaos gods can hear. His tail twitches in tiny figure-eights.
The huddle breaks.
Dex takes the snap.
Pocket collapsing.
Phan chips a linebacker.
Fionn flares out.
But it’s all noise. This play is written in squirrel.
Faolán vanishes at the line—corner bites left, but Faolán was never there. He double-cuts up the seam, spiraling around a safety who’s now questioning reality itself.
Dex launches it.
A prayer?
A dare?
No—an offering.
Faolán reappears mid-air, tail flared wide, body twisting in a corkscrew snag that pulls gravity sideways. He lands on the 11, rolls, and pops up with two claws raised like tiny daggers.
Schlitz on the sideline, howling:
“NUT BELT JUST WON US THE GAME!!”
Dex jogs up, pats him on the back. “Told you. Tactical chaos.”
Faolán pops a hazelnut from his belt and munches. “I contain multitudes.”
!!!!!!!!! BIG TIME CHANGE AFTER GAME 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ?????????????????
Title: "Friend of the Deer"
The team’s winding down after film review. Phan’s flipping through plays on the tablet, Schlitz is using the resistance bands like a jungle gym, and Ethan’s just now realizing how weird the kicker’s stretching routine really is.
Oscar sits on the bench near the lockers, gloves in his lap, silent. He’s never been one for big talk during cooldowns.
Across the room, Dáithí is scribbling something on a whiteboard chart when he pauses.
“Hey… wait—hold up. Your name’s actually Oscar?”
The room shifts. Conversations stop.
Oscar looks up slowly. His expression unreadable.
“…Yeah.”
Ethan blinks. “Oscar? Like the myth? That Oscar?”
Oscar nods once, wiping a glove between his palms. “Os cara. Means ‘friend of the deer.’”
Dex turns his head from across the room. His ears flick once.
A moment passes.
Phan smiles and taps the side of his helmet. “Makes sense now.”
Lupa, standing arms crossed near the doorway, says nothing—but their eyes linger on him longer than usual, reading something older, deeper. A name from the Fenian Cycle. Son of Oisín. Grandson of Fionn. The bloodline of legends.
“Didn’t know that,” Dáithí murmurs. “That’s heavy.”
Oscar just shrugs. “Most people don’t ask.”
Jack’D is what they call him when things are loud. When the cleats hit turf and the play’s about to snap.
But Oscar?
Oscar is what you whisper when the woods go still.
Title: "Jack'D"
Fresh off his first practice with the Plateaus, Oscar stood outside the locker room, arms crossed, green hoodie zipped to the chin. The sun was going down behind the bleachers, painting the field gold. He hadn’t said much during drills—just played. Hard. Clean. Focused. Quarterback reads crisp. Equipment tuned to perfection. No flash, no talk.
That silence unsettled some of the older players. Most guys had to carve their identity out loud—Oscar showed up already carved.
Dex watched from midfield, helmet off, antlers glinting. “Hey Phan,” he said. “What do you make of the new guy?”
Phan squinted toward the sideline. “I dunno. He’s… precise. Like someone loaded all the plays into his head already.”
“Or like he was built in a lab,” said Schlitz, walking by.
Juno, stretching alone by the goalpost, spoke without looking up: “He checks the fit of his helmet three times before every drill. Like a machine.”
That night in the weight room, he dismantled and reassembled an old shoulder pad rig that had been tossed in the corner. Left it working better than half the team’s. That’s when Sprocket muttered it under his breath.
“Dude’s totally jacked… and dialed. Jack’D.”
Lupa, leaning against the wall, raised an eyebrow. “Nickname protocols initiated.”
And it stuck.
Not because he wanted it.
Because it fit.

But over time...
They learned that behind that name was Oscar—the deer-loving one. The quiet one who watched the herd before moving. The myth reborn in a green hoodie and cleats. A name from the old stories. Carried forward with reverence, wrapped in silence.
"Jack'D" is what he became.
But Oscar is who he’s always been.
Title: "Twin Pancake Protocol"
Third quarter. Game 3. The Narcs just sent in fresh defensive ends—cocky ones, smirking and cracking their necks like they’d already won the play.
Dex stands behind center, glances left and right. On one side: Owen. Stone-still. Breathing slow.
On the other: Eoghan. Already bouncing on his cleats. Grinning like he heard the DE insult their mother.
“Blue 42… blue 42… set—hut!”
The Narcs' ends fire off the line with everything they’ve got—speed, leverage, fury.
But Owen and Eoghan don’t flinch.
They fold them. Simultaneously.
Two perfect, thunderous pancakes.
The kind that echo through the pads. Helmets hit grass. The DEs make confused little flopping motions like someone unplugged their coding.
And the twins?
They just stand up—walk forward three steps like nothing happened. No flex. No talk. No celebration.
Owen calmly adjusts his wrist tape.
Eoghan spits out his mint leaf.
Dex chuckles under his breath and calls the next play.
Lupa into the headset:
“Mark that one. Pancake symmetry. Frame it.”
Oh Fitz… I can’t make a full-on motion Hype Video yet—but we can storyboard it, script it, design still frames, generate character shots, title cards, and even line up the beats for when we do get someone to animate or film it. Think:
Smash-cut intro: Shot of Dex zipping up his hoodie, QR code glinting
Slow-mo hit reels: Fionn juking a defender / Faolán corkscrewing midair
Overlay text: “THE PLATEAUS ARE RISING.”
Music cue: Low drone → drumline → bagpipes over distorted bass
Pancake twins moment: synchronized crunch + camera shake
Final beat: Juno’s silhouette mid-kick, the sun flaring behind him
VO: “One squad. One summit. One season to climb.”
You want me to lay it out like that? Name it, script it, storyboard the scenes?
Say less, Fitz. We’re going full “Feral Energy: Rise of the Plateaus”—a cinematic hype trailer set to “Shades” by Alix Perez & Eprom. Glitchy, dark, raw, powerful. The perfect soundbed to unleash this squad.
