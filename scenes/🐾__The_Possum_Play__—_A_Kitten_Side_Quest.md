🐾 "The Possum Play" — A Kitten Side Quest
It was just past 2AM in the shadowy outskirts of a bowling alley-turned-underground-recruiting-hall, lit only by neon signs and the flickering TV near the bar. Inside, a wiry, chain-smoking linebacker named "Spatula" was threatening to sign with the Narcs, and Kitten didn’t like that one bit.
He sat across the table in his threadbare Plateaus scout jacket, shades on, chewing a cigar like it owed him money.
Spatula:
“Listen, I like what the Plateaus say—but the Narcs are offering a gear stipend, a hype video, and a scooter.”
Kitten didn’t flinch. He reached slowly into his duffel bag.
Spatula squinted.
“What’re you doing.”
A moment later, Kitten pulled out a shoebox-sized cage, the door already swinging open.
Out stepped a live possum, cool as ice. It blinked slowly, then waddled across the table and stared directly at Spatula.
Kitten (calmly):
“This is Larry. He’s got a nose for character. And he doesn’t like traitors.”
Spatula backed up.
Spatula:
“You brought a possum?”
Kitten:
“I brought leverage. You want a scooter. We’ve got tradition. We’ve got grit. We’ve got Larry.”
The possum hissed once, then casually licked its paw.
Spatula stared at the creature. Kitten tossed a BRAWNDO bottle across the table. Larry caught it. No one knows how.
Kitten:
“You wanna be remembered or you wanna be sponsored by teeth-whitening apps?”
The next morning, Spatula signed with the Plateaus.
Larry got a protein bar and a booster seat in the van.
No one ever saw the possum again—but to this day, his name is scratched into the back wall of Kitten’s locker, just below the words:
“Don’t negotiate without leverage.”


I'm here to help explore complex, meaningful topics — including serious issues like addiction — with care and depth. You’re absolutely right that substance use and abuse are realities that impact many lives, and art, storytelling, and conversation can be powerful ways to explore those experiences. I’m fully down to help you tell a thoughtful, raw, honest story about a teammate struggling with drug use — especially if the goal is to create empathy, insight, or a turning point in your narrative.
What I can’t do is generate or modify images that appear to glorify or promote illegal drug use, even as satire — that’s where I’m bound by guidelines. But if you want to depict the emotional toll, the conflict in the locker room, the confusion of teammates, the fear, the loyalty, the redemption arc — all of that? I’m all in.
If you want to file a formal complaint or give feedback, you can do that directly through the app or website you’re using — there’s usually a “Feedback” button or a help/support section where your thoughts can go straight to the team behind the scenes.
Also, I get that you’re pushing the edge here — maybe even to make a point. I respect that. So if you're still game, let’s do something powerful with this theme. Want to try telling the story of how a character like Sean is hiding his use, and how the others gradually figure it out and rally around him? Or how someone finds the broken piece in his locker and everything changes? You drive — I’ll ride shotgun.
