The Locker Room After Game 3 – Steam, Stink, and Shenanigans
Dex flops back onto the bench, his pads creaking and his short brown deer fur matted with sweat. “Did anyone else feel like the Narcs brought their entire national guard on defense today?”
Phan, half out of his uniform, towel over one shoulder, chuckles. “Yeah, and I juked the same linebacker three times. Poor guy spun himself into another tax bracket.”
Jack’D, still catching his breath, slaps a hand on his knee. “Couldn’t tell. I was too busy getting personal with the turf every third snap. They blitzed like they owed me money.”
Finn, cross-legged on the floor in his camo gear, runs a hand through his buzzed hair. “Lupa says it’s because we’ve got soft eyes. We gotta start seeing the game as it is, not as we want it to be.”
Speedy zips by, still bouncing like he hasn’t burned off enough adrenaline, mockingly parroting, “Soft eyes, hard pads, tight butts.” He pauses, lifts his jersey to fan his abs, and adds, “Y’all just jealous I don’t even sweat.”
Lupa, lurking by the whiteboard with a tablet and a Gatorade, cuts in dryly: “Speedy, I’ve seen gazelles on the Serengeti get caught by lions for less bragging.”
The room bursts into laughter. Sprocket the raccoon equipment manager pokes his head in. “Who left a cup in the sink again?! You guys think those things rinse themselves?”
Dex, without missing a beat: “That was mine. It was soaking in the holy water.”

Wanna see this illustrated like that scene? Or build out the rest of the post-game cooldown?

Phan blushes, thinking of Dex leaving his cup behind in the locker room.  Dex notices, “what’s up phan, you jealous you didn’t find it before sprocket?  Probably would’ve ended up in your equipment bag, or your bedroom.”  Phan blushes harder and blurts out “yeah, right, in your dreams, dex” but starts squirming, obviously hiding his growing excitement.  “It’s a good thing you’re still wearing yours or I’ve got a feeling I’d be seeing whether you’re telling the truth.”  “jeez, guys, get a hotel” says speedy, “and preferably invite me to your room.”  Phan, now almost red and visibly squirming gets up quickly “I gotta go guys, nature calls”  “We know what kind of nature is calling you, bro” speedy says as phan darts to the bathroom.
Finn looks around the room nervously, surprised at how forward the animals are with each other and their instincts.  Jack’D stretches, groaning, “man, maybe if you guys spent less time flirting and more time guarding me I wouldn’t be so sore right now, fuck, I could use a massage, I wish we had an on-team masseuse”  “you know, jack, I could always give you a massage, I mean, if you’d be ok with that, I mean, I don’t want it to seem like, uh, you know what I mean” “ok with that?  You’re the first pick on my roster, little bro” Jack says, winking at him.  The atmosphere is intense as the heat of the game and their animal instincts lingers.

Totally hear you, Fitz—and you’re asking exactly the right question. I appreciate that you're being thoughtful about it and trying to stay in the clear. You're right that the scene doesn’t explicitly cross lines into overtly sexual content, but it does nudge up against the boundary when it comes to suggestive language, anatomical focus (like protective cups and physical arousal cues), and flirtation that implies more than just platonic energy—even if it's subtle and humorous.
What likely tripped things up:
Blushing + squirming + implication of physical excitement (which veers into inferred sexual content)
References to what someone would do with another player’s gear in their bedroom
Speedy’s invitation and the “nature calls” line that could be read as innuendo
Finn reacting to others’ instincts (which anthropomorphizes animals in a way that starts to get into mature territory)
The massage line which, by itself, might be fine—but paired with the other things starts painting a more mature picture
You're 100% right to say it feels like locker room humor between friends—banter, teasing, flirtation, all of it can be totally normal in many circles. The challenge is that even indirect references to arousal or sexually suggestive behavior can fall under policy guidelines for mature or adult content, which gets flagged even when it’s framed playfully or metaphorically.
The good news? You can absolutely keep that fun, clever, innuendo-charged banter and we just dial back the specifics slightly—focus more on facial expressions, reactions, and the emotional beats rather than the physical implications. I can help rework it so it still sparkles with your voice and the characters’ dynamics, and keeps their personalities loud and clear without triggering any blockers.
Want me to take a crack at rewriting it with those guidelines in mind?
