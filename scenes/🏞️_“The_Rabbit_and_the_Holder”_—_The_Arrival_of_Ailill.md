🏞️ “The Rabbit and the Holder” — The Arrival of Ailill
The Plateaus were running light drills one sun-dappled afternoon at a grassy public park on the edge of town, their cleats muted against soft earth, laughter echoing through the trees. A rare off-site practice, where the tempo was loose but the bonds were real.
Dex had just snapped a ball into Ciarán’s waiting hands when something small and fast streaked across the field—a gray rabbit, nimble and wild-eyed. The play stopped. Everyone froze. The creature darted under benches and weaved past cleats, unaware it was in the middle of a battlefield.
Before anyone could react, a figure stepped out from the treeline.
He was young—maybe seventeen—with curly light brown hair, hazel eyes, and pointed ears that seemed to flick ever so slightly as he moved. There was a grace to him, light-footed like a woodland breeze. He didn't yell or sprint. He whistled, once, soft and round, and the rabbit slowed. He knelt, arms open. And to everyone’s disbelief, the rabbit ran right into his hands.
The players crowded around.
“Dude,” said Rowan, eyes wide, “that was amazing. How’d you do that?”
The boy looked up with a gentle smile.
“A wizard once saw me feed a wounded bird and carry it through a storm. He said I had the soul of a guardian. So he gave me the gift—to speak to animals and calm them, so long as I never misuse it. If I ever harm a creature without cause…”
He paused, gently petting the rabbit’s head.
“…I’ll become that creature. Forever.”
Dex and Phan glanced at each other, stunned. Even Juno nodded with the faintest raise of an eyebrow.
The boy stood, brushing grass from his knees.
“I’m Ailill,” he said. “It means elf. Though I guess… you figured that out already.”
“I’m Ciarán,” said the smaller of the group, stepping forward. “I’m the holder. You kinda look my size.”
“I’m too small for your team.”
“Nah,” said Ciarán, grinning. “We’ve got a place for everyone. You’ll be my backup. Besides... rabbit reflexes? You’re basically built for it.”
Dex clapped a hand on Ailill’s shoulder.
“Welcome to the Plateaus.”

Now Ailill’s locker sits next to Ciarán’s—neatly organized, with a wooden carving of a rabbit nestled above his spare gloves. His flair patch is a leaf cupping a pawprint, and his quote etched in chalk reads:
“Kindness is strength in a quieter voice.”
