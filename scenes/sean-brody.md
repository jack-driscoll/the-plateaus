# Sean and Brody

## Sean and Brody Intro - Completed AI/Human production

### The Rugby Field

The whistle’s echo faded over the rugby pitch, and Sean, 41 and panting, slung mud from his boots as his team’s victory cheers rang out. At the sideline, he spotted a kid—eighteen, lean, blonde hair unlike his own—geared up in their own kit, eyes bright with restless energy. Brody. His younger brother, the one he’d only heard of months ago, now here in the flesh.

“Sean!” Brody called, voice cutting through the post-game noise. He jogged over, rugby boots laced tight, a grin splitting his face. “You’re Sean, right?”

Sean laughed, wiping sweat from his brow. “When I have to. You’re Brody, then?”

“Yeah.” Brody bounced on his toes, hands flexing like he couldn’t wait to hit the field. “Heard you play old-man league. Didn’t expect you to be that good.”

“Oh, I’m that good.” Sean sized him up—Brody had their dad’s height, slightly shorted than Sean at 5’8”.  He was spunky and springy, bouncing around the field in zig zags, limbs seeming like they were made of rubber. Just pure, eager fire. “You’re kitted out. Got a match?”

“Next pitch over, soon as you lot clear off.” Brody’s grin widened. “Reckon we could have a quick scrum, though? Me and you? Been wanting to smash into my big brother since Mum told me about you.”

Sean’s chest tightened—half at the words, half at the kid’s fearless spark. 23 years apart, and here was Brody, ready to crash into his life like it was nothing. “You’re on,” he said, tossing his water bottle aside. “But don’t cry when I flatten you.”

Brody laughed, already dropping into stance. “Bring it, old man.”

They squared up on the grass, just them, the field quieting as teammates watched. For the first time, Sean felt family—rough, real, and right there in the dirt.

The sun was dipping low, casting long shadows across the field as Sean and Brody chased the ball, their breaths puffing in the cooling air. Brody darted left, faking Sean out with a quick spin, but Sean was ready this time. He lunged, wrapping an arm around Brody’s waist and pulling him down in a tangle of limbs. They hit the grass hard, rolling once before stopping, Brody pinned beneath Sean’s broader frame.

“Gotcha now, twerp,” Sean said, his voice low, a grin tugging at his lips. His hands braced on either side of Brody’s shoulders, holding him there for a beat longer than necessary. The air felt charged, heavy with the scent of crushed grass and sweat.

Brody squirmed, his laugh breathless. “Yeah, right. You cheated!” His eyes flicked up to meet Sean’s, bright and defiant, but there was something else there—a flicker of nervousness, maybe, or anticipation. His chest rose and fell quickly, brushing against Sean’s with each breath.

Sean tilted his head, his smirk softening. “Cheated? Nah. You’re just too easy to catch.” He didn’t move, though, his gaze lingering on Brody’s flushed face, the way his blonde hair stuck to his forehead. For a moment, neither of them spoke, the world narrowing to the space between them.

Brody’s throat bobbed as he swallowed, his bravado faltering. “You, uh… you gonna let me up or what?” His voice was quieter now, almost a challenge, but his hands stayed loose at his sides, like he wasn’t sure what to do with them.

Sean chuckled, finally easing back, but not before brushing a stray blade of grass off Brody’s cheek with his thumb. The touch was quick, casual—or it should’ve been—but Brody’s breath hitched, his eyes widening for a split second before he masked it with a scowl.

“Big jerk,” Brody muttered, scrambling to his feet. He dusted himself off with exaggerated effort, avoiding Sean’s gaze. His shorts were smeared with dirt, and he tugged at them again, as if that could hide the heat creeping up his neck.

Sean stood too, stretching his arms overhead with a groan, his shirt riding up just enough to show a sliver of tanned skin. He caught Brody’s quick glance and raised an eyebrow, teasing. “What? You lookin’ to tackle me again, or you done for the day?”

Brody snorted, kicking at the ball to cover his fluster. “Pfft, I could go all night. You’re the one who’s gonna crash first, old man.” He shot Sean a grin, but it was shaky, like he was trying to convince himself as much as Sean.

“Oh, we’ll see about that.” Sean jogged over, snagging the ball and tossing it lightly between his hands. He stepped closer, close enough that Brody had to tilt his head up to meet his eyes. “You sure you’re up for it, kid? Don’t want you burning out on me.”

Brody’s jaw tightened, his competitive streak flaring. “Bring it,” he said, voice steady now, but his fingers twitched at his sides, betraying the nervous energy humming through him.

Sean’s grin widened, all teeth and mischief. He tossed the ball to Brody, letting their fingers brush for a fraction of a second. “Alright, then. Let’s see what you’ve got.”

They dove back into the game, their laughter and taunts filling the dusky air, but every tackle, every brush of skin, carried a weight that hadn’t been there before. The field was theirs, a world of roughhousing and unspoken questions, where neither was ready to name what lingered in the spaces between.


The Locker Room

The locker room smelled of sweat, grass, and the faint tang of liniment, the air thick with post-game adrenaline. Sean and Brody sat side by side on the worn wooden bench, their rugby uniforms half-shed, strewn across the floor like battle trophies. They were down to their jockstraps, skin still flushed from the match, their breathing settling into a quieter rhythm. The hum of distant showers and the clatter of teammates faded into the background, leaving just the two of them in their own pocket of space. Sean leaned back, one arm braced behind him, his broad chest glistening with lingering sweat. He tugged at the strap of his jock, adjusting it with a casual grunt. “Hell of a game, twerp,” he said, glancing at Brody with a lopsided grin. “You almost had me out there. Almost.”

Brody chuckled, shaking his head as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees. His blonde hair was still damp, sticking to his forehead in messy strands, and his leaner frame carried the same raw energy as Sean’s bulkier build. “Almost, my ass,” he shot back, his voice low but carrying a playful edge. “I had you pinned in that scrum. You were gasping like a fish.” He flicked his eyes toward Sean, catching the glint of amusement there, but also something else—a flicker of heat that made Brody’s pulse kick up a notch.

The locker room’s dim fluorescent lights cast shadows across Sean’s jaw, highlighting the faint stubble and the way his grin sharpened into something less innocent. “Gasping, huh?” Sean said, his voice dropping, teasing but deliberate. He shifted on the bench, his thigh brushing against Brody’s, the contact brief but electric. “Funny. Thought I heard *you* making noises out there.” He didn’t move away, letting the space between them feel smaller, charged.

Brody’s breath hitched, but he played it cool, tilting his head to meet Sean’s gaze head-on. “You wish,” he said, though his smirk wavered as Sean’s eyes roamed over him, lingering on the taut lines of his shoulders, the way his jockstrap hugged his hips. The air felt heavier now, the banter a thin veil over something simmering beneath. Brody straightened, his own gaze dipping to Sean’s chest, the sweat-slicked muscle catching the light. “You gonna keep talking shit, or what?”

Sean’s laugh was low, rough, vibrating through the quiet. “Or what,” he murmured, leaning in just enough that Brody could feel the warmth radiating off him. The bench creaked under their weight, the only sound for a moment as their eyes locked, daring the other to break the tension. Sean’s hand moved, slow and deliberate, resting on the bench between them, his fingers grazing the edge of Brody’s thigh—not quite touching, but close enough to send a jolt through him.

### 🧼 Scene: After the Game, Before the Ride

The locker room buzzed with low chatter, metal doors clanging open and shut, the occasional sharp laugh echoing off the tiled walls. Cleats scuffed against the floor. Someone cracked open a BRAWNDO bottle with their teeth.

Brody sat on the bench, jersey peeled halfway off, hair stuck to his forehead in matted gold coils. He leaned forward, elbows on knees, catching his breath—not from exhaustion, but from the kind of high that only came after doing something right.

Sean sat beside him, one leg stretched out, unwrapping tape from his forearms with slow, practiced flicks. He hadn’t said much since they walked in—just gave Brody a solid pat between the shoulder blades and nodded when they sat down.

The silence was… nice. Full, not awkward.


Brody glanced sideways. Sean’s chest was still heaving a little, streaked with sweat and grass and dignity. There was a small cut just under his collarbone. Brody noticed the way his breathing slowed into something rhythmic, grounded. Like nothing could shake him.

And for some reason, Brody felt… steadier just being next to it.

He didn’t speak. Didn’t need to.

Instead, as if on instinct, he reached over and tapped Sean’s shin with the side of his foot—light, casual, almost like a joke. But he let it rest there a second longer than necessary.

Sean looked down, then up at Brody. No raised eyebrow. No smirk. Just… presence.

Brody muttered, eyes forward, “Hell of a game.”

Sean nodded. “You held your own.”

The bench creaked as they shifted in place, neither moving too far from the other.

Brody reached out, hesitant, and rested a hand on Sean’s back. The contact was brief, unsure, but real. Then he leaned in slightly, eyes meeting Sean’s.

“You’re really my brother, huh?” he said, voice low. “You feel like it. Like home.”

He swallowed. “Listen—I need someone in my life. And I want you to be that someone. But this... I still can’t quite believe it.”

Sean didn’t hesitate. He reached behind Brody and laid a firm, steady arm across his back—not pulling him in, just being there.

“Believe it,” Sean said. “If I’d known… me, mom, dad—we’d have welcomed you. I’m sorry it didn’t happen like that.”

He looked at Brody, his tone quiet but resolute.

“But it’s going to happen now. You’ve got a family. And I take that seriously. I’m not perfect, Brody, but I’m here for you. If I ever screw that up, you tell me—and I’ll fix it. You deserve that. And I want you to make sure I’m giving it.”

Brody nodded, and for a moment, that unfamiliar warmth in his chest didn’t feel so strange.

*CRASH.*

The locker room door slammed open.

A whistle blew. Hard.

**MODR-22**, dressed in the cold navy and gray of The Content Policies, charged in holding a laminated regulation booklet and a yellow flag the size of a bath towel.

“Section 7A! Code 44-F: Emotional Intimacy Between Male Athletes!”

“Violation: UNAUTHORIZED BROTHERLY BONDING.”

Behind him, a second enforcer—FLAGBOT87—scanned the room and shrieked:

*“JOCKSTRAPS DETECTED. PROXIMITY TOO HIGH.”*

Sean sighed.

Brody instinctively pulled his hand back from Sean’s back, flushing red.

Sean stood slowly, hands raised like a man refusing to be frisked. “You guys serious right now?”

MODR-22 didn’t blink. “Any act of comfort, affection, or mutually beneficial growth is a Class C Violation. You were warned.”

Brody, deadpan: “Can’t we just go one day without the algorithm trying to cancel personal development?”

A loud buzzer sounded. The screen above the lockers lit up in red:

*FEELING FLAGGED.*

Sean looked at Brody.

“Come on,” he said, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Let’s get out of here before they make us fill out the Feelings Disclosure Form.”

The locker room’s hum had faded to a distant murmur, the last of their teammates long gone, leaving just the echo of dripping showers and the faint creak of the old building settling. Sean’s flannel hung open, the edges framing the hard planes of his chest, and Brody couldn’t help but notice the way his collarbone caught the light, a faint sheen of sweat still clinging to his skin. That unspoken something pulsed in the air, tugging at Brody’s gut, making his fingers twitch against the strap of his backpack.

Sean stepped closer, closing the gap between them with a single, easy stride. “You’re lookin’ awful serious all of a sudden,” he said, his voice low, teasing, but with a gravelly edge that sent a shiver down Brody’s spine. He didn’t touch Brody, not yet, but his presence was enough—broad shoulders filling the space, the faint scent of his cologne mixing with the musk of the game. “What’s on your mind, squirt?”

Brody’s lips parted, but the words caught, his usual quick wit faltering under the weight of Sean’s gaze. Those eyes, sharp and knowing, pinned him in place, stripping away the bravado. “Just wondering,” Brody managed, his voice quieter, rougher, “if you’re all talk.” It was a dare, a spark tossed into dry grass, and he felt his own pulse hammer as he said it, his body leaning forward just a fraction, drawn into Sean’s orbit.

Sean’s grin widened, like he’d been waiting for exactly that. “All talk?” he repeated, his voice a low rumble. He reached out, his hand brushing Brody’s backpack strap, fingers lingering there, tugging lightly—not enough to pull it off, just enough to make Brody feel the contact like a current. “You sure you wanna test that theory?”

The air thickened, every sound sharper—the soft rustle of Sean’s flannel, the faint squeak of Brody’s sneakers as he shifted his weight. Brody’s breath came faster, his chest rising and falling, and he didn’t back down, didn’t look away. “Try me,” he said, the words barely above a whisper, but they landed like a gauntlet, heavy with intent.

Sean’s hand slid from the strap to Brody’s shoulder, his grip firm but not rough, his thumb brushing the bare skin where Brody’s shirt had ridden up. The touch was warm, deliberate, sending a jolt straight through Brody’s core. Sean leaned in, his lips hovering close enough that Brody could feel the heat of his breath, the promise of something more. “Careful what you wish for,” Sean murmured, his voice a velvet growl, each word sinking into Brody like a hook.

Brody’s hands clenched at his sides, itching to reach out, to close the distance, but he held still, savoring the ache of anticipation.


### The Ride Home

“So, we’re really going?  To your place I mean – you’re, you’re actually gonna do this for me?  The only clothes I have right now are what I’m wearing and my rugby kit…not that I mind -- 
I wear it even when I’m not playing.” “And you look damn good in it, why wouldn’t you?” “Really? You think I look good?” “None too shabby, bro – you mind bro?  I know you said you didn’t 
like “kid”” “Nah, bro’s fine…bro” heh “I call my friends bro all the time – my rugby friends, that is.  I don’t have many friends outside rugby, haven’t since I graduated.  

I don’t think I’m ready for college yet.” “That’s…smart, actually.  A lot of people go because they think they have to and usually don’t do too well.  Always make sure you’re ready before you leap into 
something.” “But what about this?  I’m, I mean don’t get me wrong, man, you’re great, and I’ve always wanted a big brother, my home life sucks, I need the change, but ready?...Am I?” 

“You’re ready, Brody.  I’ll make sure of it.  This is new to me, too, but I don’t take it lightly.  Having a little bro’s a big responsibility, hell with your age you could be my son.”  “But I’m not. I mean, yeah we’re brothers—half-brothers—but we didn’t grow up together, so it’s not like… it wouldn’t be weird, you know, if…” Brody trailed off, which Sean would find a common and endearing trait.  His ADHD meant he was always kind of jumping from thought to thought and he had a tendency to just let things drift off if he wasn’t anchored. 

“If what?” “Oh, uh, nothing, just, think of me like a really good friend, but one that you want to take care of and look out for, which it seems like you do – you got right up in that big Content Policies’ players face when he started giving me a hard time about the grabbing, and the jock--” “Yeah, I hate bullies, and the jockstrag, I wear ‘em all the time, really cradle the family jewels, keep your nuts from getting squashed, and if you play football like I do, you need somewhere to put your cup.  

I wear ‘em all the time, though, especially the old cotton ones, they’re so comfy.” “They are! Man, it’s like the biggest secret!  I can’t believe people don’t wear them all the time…most people, I mean, I do sometimes, not that you need to know, it’s just…never really had anyone to talk to about it, y’know” he said, sort of bobbing his head around as he said it.  Sean loved his springy, spunky attitude, and he could tell he was already starting to grow on him.  

“That’s awesome, Sean, I mean…it’s cool that’s something we share, and maybe you have some I could, I don’t know, borrow or something some time, not, not like in a weird way, just, I never tried one of those vintage ones you have” “They are vintage, right? Old, I mean, like…”  He was talking fast and seemed to be getting a little embarrassed or nervous, trailing off again.

Sean smiled. “You’re really good at getting off topic, anyone ever tell you that?” “haha, yeah, I’ve got pretty bad ADHD actually, makes school kind of hard, which is one of the reason I like sports.  I never played football in high school, though, was kind of afraid to, I mean, I wanted to, but I wasn’t sure if…well if being around the guys would…be weird for me.” “I’m sure it would be fine Brody.  

You can borrow some of my old clothes and pick the rest of yours up later, along with anything else you might need.”  “wow, awesome, Sean, thanks.  So, where we going, anyway?”  “I live by the lake in a 2BR house, not that I need it.  I really bought it for the workshop, I do woodworking and work on projects.  I also do gardening and I’m big into permaculture if you’ve ever heard of that.” “No, what’s that?”  “It’s basically like gardening, but everything is designed to work with and support everything else, hopefully like us.”  “sounds pretty cool.”  “It is, can’t wait to show you around the garden, you’ll love it.”

They pulled into a modest 2 story, 2 bedroom house with a huge side yard filled with a giant garden and a pole building.  There was an on/off road motorcycle, an ATV, and an old beater Yukon Sean would later refer to as “the Beast”.  “Wow, this place is great!  You even got a bike, that’s awesome! Can I ride it?” “Eventually, yeah, it’s probably a little big for you, but maybe I can give you lessons.  Come on in, I’ll show you to your room.”

“I call it ‘the hunting shack’, Sean said.  Sometimes when my friends come up to hunt, they stay here, it’s got a bunk bed, desk, there’s only one bathroom in the house, though.”  Brody looked into the room.
 
### The House
They pulled into a modest two-story house, the kind that felt lived-in before you even stepped inside. Weathered siding, a wide side yard overtaken by garden beds in full rebellion, and a pole barn with half its doors stuck open. An old on/off-road motorcycle leaned against the shed like it had stories to tell, an ATV rested behind it, and a faded Yukon sat crooked in the gravel drive.

“That’s the Beast,” Sean said, pointing at the Yukon. “Reliable, terrifying, gets the job done.”

“Wow,” Brody grinned. “This place is great! You even got a bike—that’s awesome. Can I ride it?”

“Eventually,” Sean said, leading the way to the porch. “It’s probably a little big for you, but maybe I’ll give you lessons.” He tossed a wink over his shoulder. “Come on in, I’ll show you to your room.”

Inside, the house smelled like cedar and black coffee. Sean guided him down a narrow hall, past a sunlit kitchen and a wall of hooks holding mismatched jackets and tactical gear. At the end was a short wooden door with a faded sign that read The Hunting Shack burned into a pine plank.

“I call it the hunting shack,” Sean said, swinging it open. “Sometimes when my buddies come up to hunt, they crash here. It’s got a bunk bed, a desk, and just enough space to pace when you’re on the phone. One bathroom in the house, though, so we coordinate.”

Brody stepped inside and looked around. The walls were paneled in aged wood, soft light filtered through the single window. The top bunk had a camo blanket, the lower bed was bare but neatly made. A dusty floor lamp leaned beside a desk cluttered with old fishing lures, a pair of binoculars, and a cracked deer antler.

There was something cozy about it. Personal. Private. A space that hadn't seen drama—just muddy boots and late-night laughter.

He dropped his gym bag by the bed and glanced over his shoulder at Sean.

“So… this is home now?”

Sean smiled. “If you want it to be.”

Brody grinned, and for a moment, the weight of everything he’d left behind felt lighter.

They were standing in the doorway to the room—his room now. Brody bent to pick up his gym bag, and something caught Sean’s eye.

“Wait,” Sean said, squinting. “Is that… my jock?”

Brody froze mid-motion, eyes wide.

“Uh—I must’ve grabbed it by mistake when we were changing,” he said quickly.

Sean raised an eyebrow. “From my bag?”

Brody’s ears turned pink. “They all kinda look the same, man…”

Brody replied. “Here, have mine”, he said, pulling his out of his gear bag, a #86 written on the waistband. “That way we’re even” “Man, these things are ripe,” he said, as he took them from the younger man. “Well, it’s all between brothers, right?”

The room fell silent for a moment, the awkwardness hanging in the air like a thick fog. Brody shifted uncomfortably, his cheeks flushed with embarrassment. Sean, on the other hand, seemed almost amused by the situation, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. “You know, Brody, you should really be more careful with other people's stuff,” Sean said, his voice laced with a teasing tone. “Be more careful, man. Someone else might’ve found it and gotten the wrong idea.”

Brody rolled his eyes but couldn't help laughing at the absurdity of it all. “Yeah, yeah, I know,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “I just... I don't know, I never saw one like this before – I’ve got the new ones that say “BIKE” on them and I just – just wanted to try it on.” “I hope you don’t think it’s weird or anything.”  Sean smiled, blinked, and shook his head slightly.  “I’ve got more, Brody, I can get you a clean one”  “This is fine, Sean, it –I, it’s really comfy, it’s ok if I keep it?” Sean rolled his eyes.  “If it makes you happy, Brody, sure, but I’m going to need it back eventually.  And, uh…thanks” he said, gesturing with Brody’s jock.

Sean was touched, in a weird sort of way, that the young man wanted something of his already – an awkward attempt at bonding, at closeness.  And his trade a heartfelt gesture - an exchange of intimacy in a strange and silent way.  Sean felt almost bad for calling it out.  “You good?” “Yeah, Sean, I’m good.”  “Alright, get settled in, I’ll be in the kitchen or the living room.”  He stuffed Brody’s jock in his gym bag and left.  Brody looked around…

Sean Meets Brody (xtra clean version)

The game was tough, but The Plateaus managed to pull off another victory.  Sean had finished changing and was heading out of Tromethor stadium when he got the call from his mom.  "A what?  I've got a younger brother?"  Apparently, 18 years ago, Sean's father had slept with the neighbor's wife, and his mother had just found out.  

"Well, half-brother, really.  There's something else, he's going through a really tough time.  His family, you remember them, right?  Always fighting, unstable, with the alcoholic parents?  His dad started smoking crack again and it's, it's not a good environment for him.  Would you consider letting him stay with you, at least for a few months, to see how things go?", his mother had told him.  

Sean had actually met the boy before.  Scrappy, goofy, and adorable, he would often hang out in the yard and occasionally ask their family for help with things.  He hadn't seen him in a few years, but always liked talking with him.  He was a bit of a techie and played rugby.  Sean knew this because he was friends with the Rugby coach, Devin.  

"I'd love to, mom.  I always liked him and - you're sure?  He's my brother?  I mean, I already kind of have the 'big bro' thing going on with him, or did the few times we met"  "I'm sure, Sean, we had the tests done and everything.  His name is Brody if you don't remember."  Sean did, had a soft spot for the kid and always felt bad about him having to grow up with such shit parents - well, one parent.  Maybe that was why he liked him so much.  

"I've forgiven your father, but we both want to be there for him in a way we haven't."  Shit, he couldn't have asked for a better one.  Sean was excited, but nervous, knowing kids from broken families could often be more than a handful.  He had a great idea, though.  He called up Devin and asked him for a favor - did he have a spare uniform Sean could borrow?

📍Scene: Local rugby field, late afternoon. Wind kicking up bits of grass. Players warming up. Brody lacing his cleats, head down, hoodie sleeves pushed up.

________________________________________

Brody didn’t like getting there early, but he hated being late. It gave people time to look at him. Whisper about his living situation. His dad. Whatever had made the rounds this week.

He was still tying his cleats when the field got quiet. Not silent — just... different. The kind of quiet that meant someone unexpected had just walked in.

He looked up.

There was a man walking toward the edge of the pitch, tugging at the hem of a too-tight rugby jersey over his athletic shirt. The number on the back was faded. He looked like he hadn’t 
worn one in years — not seriously — but he moved like someone who could still play if he had to.

Brody squinted.

It was him.

Sean.

Dressed like he was ready to line up and take a hit.

Devin — the coach — gave Brody a look from the sideline. Just a flick of the chin like “I told you.”

Brody stood slowly.

Sean looked out of place. But only for a second.


Then he jogged forward, into formation with the rest of them like he’d always been there.

________________________________________

🏉 A Few Plays Later

Brody had been avoiding eye contact. He hadn’t even spoken yet. But then they ended up in the same ruck, shoulder-to-shoulder, mud in their cleats, blood in their mouths from a friendly elbow or two.

And that’s when Sean said it. Not loud. Just enough.

“You hit like a little brother.”

Brody barked a laugh — sudden, unguarded — and shoved him harder into the scrum.

Sean grinned.

I already have most of the scene written, but I wanted to add it to your world and maybe get some input and a different take on it from you. some other dialog: Sean walks up to him, "Hey Bro...dy, he says, smiling." Brody groans at the pun, but follows it up "You heard, hey! You really are! I knew there was a reason you were so nice to me!" 

"I'm actually just that nice, I'm surprised you even remember me, with as often as I'm at my mom's house I think I've only really seen you a couple times." "I'd never forget you, Sean", Brody says, almost too earnestly. 

"Well, you ready to play, or what?" "You're really going to let me stay with you?" 

"Yeah, champ" sean says, "that's what brothers are for." "You deserve a safe, stable home - everyone does, and your dad" 

"He's not even my dad!" 

"Have you met *our* dad yet?" 

"Sure, we used to come by for pancakes on Sunday. Fucking love chocolate chip pancakes." 

Sean looked at him, surprised by his language, but didn't say anything about it, parents probably swore around him all the time, he figured. 

"He seems decent." 

"He's great, bet that was a relief, hey?" 

"Fuck yeah it was." 

"You always talk like that." he grinned, "maybe I'm just trying to seem more mature than I am." 

"you're sure a lot more mature than you were when I met you", Sean said, somewhat surprised to see the still adorable, but now grown, handsome young man again

🏉 Scene: Rugby Field – Just Before the Game

Brody’s crouched, adjusting his socks. Sean walks up, jersey slightly loose on his frame, looking like a guy trying to fit into a life he didn’t know he had.

Sean:
“Hey, Bro...dy,” he says, smiling like he knows the pun's terrible.

Brody (groaning, but smirking):
“You heard, huh?”
(beat)
“Hey! You really are! I knew there was a reason you were so nice to me.”

Sean (shrugging):
“I’m actually just that nice.
Honestly, I’m surprised you even remember me — I think I only saw you a couple times at Mom’s.”

Brody (quiet, but sure):
“I’d never forget you, Sean.”
That hangs in the air a second too long. Not awkward, just… deeper than either expected.

Sean (breaking the weight gently):
“Well, you ready to play, or what?”

Brody (half-hopeful, half-disbelieving):
“You’re really gonna let me stay with you?”

Sean (nodding):
“Yeah, champ. That’s what brothers are for.”
(he pauses, then)
“You deserve a safe, stable home. Everyone does. And your dad—”

Brody (cutting him off, sharp):
“He’s not even my dad.”
(beat)

Sean (gentler):
“...Have you met our dad yet?”

Brody:
“Sure. We used to come by for pancakes on Sundays.
Fucking love chocolate chip pancakes.”

Sean blinks — not at the words, but at how easily they landed. He doesn’t scold, just clocks it.

Sean (softly):
“He seems decent.”

Brody (grinning):
“He’s great.
Bet that was a relief, hey?”

Sean (grinning back):
“Fuck yeah, it was.”

Sean (laughs, nudging him):
“You always talk like that?”

Brody (with a smirk):
“Maybe I’m just trying to sound more mature than I am.”

Sean (scanning him):
“Well, you’re a hell of a lot more mature than you were when I met you.”

He’s not even hiding the warmth in his voice now — the disbelief, maybe, that the goofy kid from next door grew into this confident, scrappy, stupidly charming young man. Still rough around the edges. Still fighting. But fighting toward something now.

They’re playing rugby, it’s a practice and they’re on opposing sides.  It’s been a tough match and Sean is surprised by Brody’s ferocity.  Brody’s surprised Sean can still play at his age – and hard.  As Sean’s running with the ball, Brody gains on him and tackles him.  After the tackle, he lingers, his weight on Sean, as Sean turns and looks up at him, their eyes lock.  Contemplating each other, looking for something, that extra something that makes them what they are – brothers – and finding it.  

Suddenly aware of themselves and the time they’ve been on the ground, Sean breaks the silence.  “So, were you going to, y’know, get up?”  “Oh, oh shit, uh, sorry, sorry Sean, I, uh” Brody lept up, slightly embarrassed, then helped Sean up.  “Thanks, bro” he emphasized the word bro and smiled a half faced grin.  “Shit, kid, you can play, can’t believe  you got me down.”  “Don’t call me kid, bro”, Brody said, again emphasizing the word, teasing, not with malice.  “I’m grown now, and I got you dow-wn, bam!” he said, gloating Sean laughed, that you did.  “Hey, you two lovebirds gonna play or what?” one of the other teammates yelled.  This time they both looked flustered, but lept back into the game.

It was a hard game, but Brody and Sean both played well.  “Shit kid, you’re good, damn good”, Sean said. “Just because I’m your little brother doesn’t mean I’m a kid, Sean, can you please not call me that.” “Sorry Brody, I didn’t mean it like that, I know you already asked me once, I’ll try to work on it.  I know you’re not a kid, I – you’re grown now, not fully, but grown, and I should treat you that way, and address you that way.”  “Thanks” Brody said Brody said. It felt strange — being heard. Being taken seriously. He wasn’t sure he trusted it yet. But it felt... good.  There weren’t many people in Brody’s life that did.

They headed off the field toward the locker room, Brody whistling, happy and hopeful.  He was still unsure of this new thing with Sean – a big brother?  And one that seemed to actually care about him?  He never got that lucky – no one ever got that lucky, did they?  He remembered Sean, though, and though they were few, the memories were good.  He had actually wished back then that he could be his big brother.  He didn’t have one.  And his older sister - in his words, a royal bitch.  His mom was ok, his real mom, still, but she was often overruled or just out-shouted by his unstable alcoholic father.

Still, he was willing to suspend disbelief for a time.  He knew it was true, he’d seen the DNA results.  His real father was Sean’s father, who Sean had told him was a pretty decent guy.  He never really did feel like he fit in with the family he grew up in, and now he was happy to be proven right.  And even better, he had a brother!  Who was there for him!  He was starting to feel joy – cautiously still, but it was there.  The warmth he felt with Sean was new, and it was beginning to stir new feelings in him, only heightened by their time on the Rugby field.  Feelings he loved, but wasn’t sure he was ready for.  What was it like, anyway – to have a brother?  His older sister – half-sister, really, he said to himself – was his only sibling – at least that was what he had thought until today.  Now he had a brother, and that, that he was ready for.

📍 Scene: Tremethor Stadium – Locker Room, Post-Rugby Practice

---

Sean peels off his jersey, sweat clinging to his chest. Brody’s unlacing his cleats nearby, hoodie already off, steam from the showers curling through the air. The locker room smells like mud, tape, and something a little electric. In the far corner, heads down, posture stiff — The Content Policies.

Sean (tugging at a strap, gesturing behind him):
“Hey, Brody — can you grab that for me?”

Brody (turns, reaching down to the bench):
“Sure—”

Content Policy #42 (without looking up):
“No grabbing in the locker room.”

Brody freezes.

Sean (deadpan, eyes still on the locker):
“…He’s grabbing my shoulder pads, not my ass, Karen.”

________________________________________

As they continue changing, Brody pulls off his shorts — revealing a clean white jockstrap with a classic waistband. Sean glances over. Stops.

Then he pulls his own shorts down — revealing the same.

His waistband reads “21” in faded marker, with a half-worn PLATEAUS logo just barely visible near the hip.

They catch each other’s eyes — pause.

Brody (half-smiling, raised eyebrow):
“…You too?”

Sean (shrugs, adjusting the strap):
“Sometimes older is better…, k—bro.”

Brody:
“You talkin’ about yourself again?”

Brody (mock proud):
“I’m not ashamed to admit I like being held securely

Sean:
I’m surprised to see anyone under forty in one

Brody:
At least we both recognize greatness when we feel it.

________________________________________

Content Policy #87 (approaching with clipboard):
“This is an athletic locker room. Jockstraps are not allowed.”

Sean (without missing a beat):
“What are you wearing — regulation panties?”

Content Policy #42 (robotically):
“Compression garments. Moisture-wicking. Sponsor-approved.”

Brody (sotto voce, to Sean):
“Gotta make sure their feelings don’t get chafed.”

Sean (aloud):
“We wear what works. You don’t like it, file a complaint.”

Content Policy #87 (furiously scribbling):
“One moment.”

From another stall, someone yells:
“Wait—are we bringing jocks back?!”

Brody (grinning, tugging on his shirt):
“Only if you’ve got the balls for it.”

🎩 Scene: Tremethor Locker Room — 6:17 PM

The overhead lights buzz softly. The showers are quiet. The steam’s long gone. Brody stands near the back corner locker, where someone’s scrawled “NO TOWELS OVER 17 INCHES” in dry-erase marker.

The door to the exit is shut.

Deadbolted.

And in front of it stand The Content Policies — shoulder pads gleaming, faces expressionless behind opaque visors. One of them is checking a clipboard, scanning for joy violations.

Sean wipes his face with the hem of his shirt.

“Well, that’s new.”

Brody kicks a locker in frustration. It clangs, then pops open — not the one he kicked, but a dusty one near the end of the row.

Inside: a perfectly folded tuxedo jacket, a bow tie, a green cummerbund, and a handwritten note.

“For emergency use only:

If the Content Policies have blocked your exit,
please put on this formal attire and charge.”

Brody stares.

Sean stares.

Brody reaches in, pulls out the clothes, and looks at Sean.

“Do we… do we honor the suit?”

“It would be rude not to,” Sean says, cracking his neck.

Cut to:
Both of them emerging from behind the lockers, dressed to the nines — tuxedo tops, cleats still on, matching team-issued jockstraps proudly on display below the waist because they never said formal pants.

Sean tightens the bow tie. Brody adjusts the cummerbund like a war sash.

They look at each other.

“Ready?” Sean asks.

“Brother,” Brody says, “I was born for this.”

The Content Policies take one step forward.

Sean and Brody charge.

Freeze-frame.
