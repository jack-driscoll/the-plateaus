Scene: Equipment Room – Day Before Game 2
The locker room hums with low chatter, the sound of cleats clinking against the concrete floor. Sprocket is sorting mouthguards in a tackle box. Jack’D (Oscar) is taping a helmet stripe in the corner. Clancy stands in front of a mirror, slowly rotating his hips, frowning deeply.
Clancy:
(holding the waistband of a Vintage Bike #10)
“This chafes.”
Sean (Assistant Equipment Manager, half-buried in a crate of athletic tape):
“You can’t chafe. You’re a crocodile.”
Clancy:
(dead serious, without breaking eye contact in the mirror)
“I am chafing.”
Sprocket glances up, silently noting the symmetrical tug on Clancy’s tail strap as the croc adjusts. Dex walks by, sees what’s happening, and wisely walks the other way.
Sean:
(sighs, pulling himself out of the crate)
“We have policies for a reason. Gear is issued, inspected, and expected to be worn. You don’t get to opt out of the jock era.”
Clancy:
“Then adapt the era. Shock Doctor compression shorts. Double-stitched. Breathable. No chafing.”
He opens a small duffel bag and pulls out a neatly folded pair like he’s presenting evidence.
Sean:
(throwing his hands up)
“I’m only allowing this because you’re a crocodile! We have these policies to keep our equipment protected by protective equipment!”
Clancy nods slowly, like a general accepting terms.
Clancy:
“Then consider this my battlefield adaptation.”
He drops the jockstrap into his locker like a condemned relic. The nameplate gleams above it: CLANCY – #92.
Sprocket:
(quietly, to no one in particular)
“Better than the time Phan tried to cut his waistband with antlers…”
Fade out with Clancy stretching silently in the background, lacing up his cleats with clinical precision.

[INT. TREMETHOR STADIUM – LOCKER ROOM SHOWERS – NIGHT]
The Plateaus had pulled off a gutsy win. Pads slammed lockers. Cleats clacked on tile. Laughter bounced off the walls like loose footballs. BRAWNDO bottles were uncapped and guzzled like victory itself.
A couple players locked eyes, grinning.
Dex (grinning):
“Alright, Ciarán—your turn. Time for your shower!”
Before he could object, Phan and Sean flanked him with mock innocence. Ciarán raised his hands, backing toward the shower room.
Ciarán (laughing nervously):
“Wait, wait, hold on—guys—”
Ethan popped in behind him like a fox on a mission.
Ethan:
“He’s cornered!”
A playful shove sent Ciarán stumbling backward past the low tile divider. His cleats squeaked as he tripped over the ledge and landed—whump—on his butt in the center of the shower floor.
Ciarán (half-groaning, half-laughing):
“Okay! That was unnecessary—but fair.”
He stayed there, elbows on knees, breathing, grinning, letting the warm shower mist hit his helmet.
Truth was, he kind of liked sitting in the showers. Always had. Something about the tile and the hiss of water muffled the world.
Dex (hoisting the orange cooler):
“Boys?”
Phan (laughing):
“Time for the rinse cycle!”
With a synchronized heave, they drenched him in a sparkling wave of yellow BRAWNDO. The liquid hit like a citrusy tsunami, soaking his jersey, pants, gloves—everything.
Ciarán (grinning with his eyes closed):
“…Delicious.”
The others took off hooting and hollering, boots slapping tile, disappearing into the echoes of celebration.
Then silence, save the gentle hiss of the showers and a faint citrus tang in the air.
A few seconds later, Speedy poked his long gazelle face around the corner, blinking at the sight.
Speedy:
“Dude… what are you covered in? Is that… did you… did they—?”
Ciarán (wiping his face with a chuckle):
“Relax, Speedy. It’s BRAWNDO. Not that I would’ve minded.”
Speedy stood frozen for a second—then burst out laughing.
Speedy (laughing):
“It’s just… it looked like something else, man—oh man—I wasn’t ready for that visual!”
Ciarán (mock-sincere):
“You never are.”
Speedy stepped forward, held out a hand. Ciarán took it, and the gazelle helped him to his feet with a clatter of pads and dripping cleats.
Speedy (grinning):
“Okay but—what did you mean, ‘you wouldn’t have minded?’”
Ciarán (shrugging, smiling as he pulled off his soaked gloves):
“Nothing, buddy. I’m just saying... I don’t mind getting wet if it’s all in good fun.”
Speedy gave him a playful nudge as they started walking back to the locker room together, squishing with every step.
Speedy (mock-serious):
“Yeah, well next time give me a heads-up before you look like a lemon-lime crime scene.”
Ciarán:
“No promises.”
Speedy:
“I’m bringing goggles.”
They both laughed, the sound fading as they stepped back into the bright hum of the locker room—where victory still echoed, and where the team waited.


"The Kick That Froze the Clock" — Plateaus Heroic Play #7
Situation:
Final seconds of the 4th quarter. The Plateaus are down by 2. Ball is on the Narcs' 37-yard line. No timeouts. Wind pushing sideways. Tremethor Stadium roaring, floodlights humming.
The Formation:
Ciarán (#42) crouched at the hold, his black spiky hair matted with sweat and steam.
Speedy (#87) lined up four steps back, hooves barely touching turf.
Rowan (#11) on the left edge, jaw clenched, copper-red hair peeking from his helmet.
Fintan, the enigmatic backup QB with the unicorn head, stood in a tight stance behind Rowan—just in case.
The Snap:
Phantom-quiet.
The ball zips from Finn’s hands into Ciarán’s. Perfect placement.
Ciarán spins it, tilts the laces, plants it like sacred stone.
Speedy launches.
It’s not a run—it’s a whipcrack.
His right leg arcs, lean and vicious, slicing air.
BOOM.
Contact.
The sound echoes off the scoreboard, off the trees, off the hearts in the crowd.
Rowan pancakes a blitzer, knocking him off-balance just long enough.
Fintan flares left, throwing a fake option to draw the safety.
The ball sails.
A tight yellow spiral. End over end. Glowing under the stadium lights.
Through the uprights. Good.
No time left. The Plateaus win.
