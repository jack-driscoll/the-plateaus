The Locker Room After Game 3 – Official Canon Version
Steam rises off sweaty pads and turf-stained cleats. The room buzzes—part relief, part leftover adrenaline, part pure chaos.
Dex drops his helmet with a heavy thunk and flops onto the bench, ears twitching. “Did anyone else feel like the Narcs were trying to tackle our souls?”
Phan, towel around his neck, chuckles while loosening his pads. “I juked the same linebacker three times. I think I owe him dinner.”
Jack’D groans as he stretches, one shoulder visibly sore. “You also let him through to body me twice. I’ve got cleat prints in places I didn’t know had nerves.”
Phan smirks, “Maybe if you didn’t run like a highlight reel we wouldn’t have to bail you out every play.”
Dex raises an eyebrow, catching Phan’s look. “You keep watching me like that, Phan, folks are gonna start thinking you're my shadow.”
Phan opens his mouth, then closes it again. “What? No—shut up, dude.”
Speedy, strutting past with a towel tucked into his waistband and zero shame in his step, chirps, “You two flirt harder than I run routes. Can y’all chill before this place turns into a rom-com?”
Dex shoots back, “Don’t worry, Speedy, you’re still the leading man in your own reflection.”
Finn, sitting on the lower bench in his camo pants and undershirt, glances up, wide-eyed at the exchange. “Are… are you guys always like this?”
Jack’D leans back, grinning through the exhaustion. “Welcome to the Plateaus, kid. Get used to it.”
He rubs his shoulder and sighs. “Man, we need a team masseuse.”
Finn perks up. “I could help? I mean—I know some recovery techniques, nothing fancy, just field training stuff. If that’s okay?”
Jack'D smirks and nods. “Field training, huh? Then you're already top of the roster.”
Lupa’s voice cuts through the din, crisp and cool from the corner where he’s reviewing a tablet. “Less flirting, more hydrating, gentlemen. Game 4 starts now.”
A low groan ripples through the room as water bottles are grabbed and gear shuffled—but the grins linger.
