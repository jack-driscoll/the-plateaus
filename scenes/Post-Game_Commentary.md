Post-Game Commentary
Later, someone chalked a message on the back wall of Sean’s locker:
“What counts as glorification — and what is just truth-telling?”
Maybe the real harm wasn’t the drug. Maybe it was the silence. Maybe it was the idea that telling a story with pain meant you were promoting it. That showing the cracks was more dangerous than hiding them.
The Plateaus had played enough games to know this:
You don’t win by pretending the field is clean.
You win by facing what’s real. Together.



Scene: Night. Sean’s room. Quiet.
The hallway light spills in through the cracked door. Sean’s at his desk, taping up his ankle. Brody leans against the doorframe in sweats and wet socks, arms crossed.
Brody:
“You always do that? Just keep playing through it?”
Sean (not looking up):
“Most of the time. Sometimes it stops hurting.”
Brody (shrugs):
“Guess I wouldn’t know. I usually just... quit before things get real.”
Sean glances up at that.
Sean:
“That why you never said anything?”
Brody goes still.
Brody:
“You mean about...?” (He gestures vaguely. Beat.)
“I didn’t know what it was. Not really. I just... I’d look at you, and it felt like something I wasn’t supposed to say out loud.”
Sean sets the tape down. Silence.
Brody (too fast, now trying to backpedal):
“I mean—not like—I don’t mean I was like into you. I just meant... it was a feeling. I get a lot of those. You’re just—you’re safe, man.”
Sean:
“…Brody.”
Brody (talking over him):
“You’re not—Don’t make it a thing. Please don’t make it a thing.”
Sean watches him. Quiet. Then:
Sean (gently):
“I wasn’t going to.”
Brody’s eyes dart. He nods once, mouth tight, and turns to leave.
Just before the door shuts, Sean says:
Sean:
“You’re allowed to feel stuff, Brody. Even about me.”
Want to dive into a scene where they talk about this dynamic—or where Brody finally asks Sean why he even took him in?
Scene: Sean’s Room, After Breakfast
The plates are still in the sink. Sunlight filters in, soft through the olive paint. Brody stands in the doorway, shoulder to the frame, arms crossed but loose.
Brody:
“Even though we're—you're my brother, after all…”
He gestures vaguely with one hand, head leaning forward, eyes searching for the right word.
Sean (softly):
“Brody, whatever you’re feeling, you’re feeling. No one’s grading you for it.”
He sets down a wrist wrap on his desk, turns fully toward him.
“You’re still young. Still figuring yourself out. Meeting me now—as an adult? It’s different. I get that.”
Brody nods once, eyes dropping. There’s a little laugh—quiet, unsure.
Sean (smiling):
“Man, you make me so happy. I still can’t believe I found you after all these years. What’s it been, a month?”
Brody:
“Little over.”
Sean:
“And in that time? We’ve been living together, playing together, being together.
Not to mention—” (he leans back in the chair with a cocky grin) “—I’m a stud.”
Brody snorts, hand to his face, shaking his head.
“You’re unreal.”
Sean:
“I mean, a little shameless self-promotion never hurt. Probably couldn’t help yourself, squirt. You showed up, saw greatness, and just imprinted like a baby duck.”
Brody:
“Don’t get too full of yourself, Sean.”
They both laugh. It’s not nervous. It’s not forced. Just that kind of laughter that says, we’re good here.
Brody steps further into the room, sitting on the edge of the bed, still in his rugby shorts from earlier.
Brody (quieter now):
“I never knew I missed something until I had it.
And now? I just—I don’t want to mess it up.”
Sean doesn’t say anything right away. He just looks at Brody for a beat, then crosses the room, placing a hand gently on his shoulder.
Sean:
“You won’t. You’re not a mess-up, Brody. You’re just new. And this—us—isn’t going anywhere.”
Brody nods, swallowing hard, jaw tight like he doesn’t want to cry. But he also doesn’t want to leave the room.
Brody:
“…Thanks.”
Sean:
“Anytime, little brother. Even if you’re obnoxiously good at fumbles.”
Brody punches him lightly in the arm.
And for a moment, the silence between them feels like it was always supposed to be there.]


🐺 Scene: “Wait… Who’s 21?”
Lupa stood with arms folded in his dark green Plateaus hoodie, tail flicking slowly behind him. His ears twitched once, twice, and then flattened slightly as he stared at the two men in front of him.
Both were tall. Muscular. Intense.
Both were wearing #21.
One—Sean—stood with that easy-brooding confidence, a war-hardened calm in his posture, the kind of man who looked like he’d stay silent until the universe really needed his opinion.
The other—Oscar—was sharper. Denser. His eyes held judgment. Not hostility, just... evaluation. Like he was figuring out the PSI rating on your shoulder pads.
They stood side by side, and neither seemed confused.
Lupa: (slowly) “Okay. This is not my fault.”
Sean tilted his head, eyebrow raised.
Sean: “What’s up?”
Lupa: “One of you is supposed to be dead. Or wearing a different number. Or imaginary. I haven’t figured out which yet.”
Oscar squinted. Harder than usual.
Oscar: “You sure this isn’t a you problem?”
Lupa opened his mouth. Closed it. Then pointed at both of them.
Lupa: “You’re both wearing twenty-one.”
Sean: “Yeah?”
Oscar: “...Yeah?”
Lupa: “That’s not allowed. It’s a numerical paradox. You’re gonna rip a hole in the depth chart and suck the Púca into it.”
Sean crossed his arms.
Sean: “Then maybe he’ll finally take his laundry back.”
Oscar muttered, “No promises,” while smirking just enough to be guilty.
Lupa pinched the bridge of his snout.
Lupa: “Alright. New plan. One of you gets traded to an alternate timeline, the other one gets taped into a new jersey with a different number.”
Oscar: “What if we’re never in the same room?”
Lupa: “That worked for Superman and Clark Kent for about a week. You’re not that sneaky.”
Sean grinned. Oscar shrugged.
And Lupa, the mythic wolf of superior intelligence and gear logistics, let out the longest sigh in Plateaus history.
