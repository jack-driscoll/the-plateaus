Plateaus Locker Room – The Rally Before the Showers
The air is thick with post-practice sweat, pride, and the lingering scent of turf and tape. Helmets are off, jerseys half peeled, pads clattering to the floor.
Dex pulls off his gloves and leans forward. “They’re gonna try to pin us down at every angle.”
Speedy stretches one leg up on the bench like a ballet dancer with abs. “Good luck catching me. I’m half lightning, half gazelle.”
Phan pulls his jersey over his head, ruffling his sweaty red fur. “They can block me all day, but they’re gonna need more than rules to slow me down.”
Finn, sitting cross-legged and adjusting his cleats, adds, voice calm but sharp:
“They’re going to try to stop us at every turn, but we’re smarter and swifter, and we’re going to find ways around them every time. The Content Policies think they can control us, but we’re going to show them who’s in control and make them take it—and take it hard.”
Jack’D lets out a low laugh and claps a hand on Finn’s shoulder. “Now that’s the spirit. Spoken like a real Plateau.”
The room erupts into hoots, cheers, and stomps on the tile floor. Steam hisses in the distance—someone just cranked on the shower.
Speedy wrinkles his nose, smirking. “It smells like five different species of ‘soaked’ in here.”
Jack’D takes an exaggerated sniff, then grins like a wolf.
“Sure does. Just how it should.”
Sprocket, their ever-dedicated raccoon equipment manager, watches from the corner, ears twitching as he starts scooping up scattered pads and loose tape rolls. He shakes his head fondly, muttering something about “furballs and their rituals.”
Dex flicks a towel at Phan, who dodges it and grabs a water bottle like a sword.
Finn is slower to move, still taking it in. He watches the team strip off their gear with ease and rhythm—each player used to the motion, the routine. He hesitates.
Jack’D calls out, already halfway to the shower with a towel over his shoulder.
“As much as I love getting geared up and pounding on the field, I’m ready to get hosed down. Last one in has to swap uniforms with me next game!”
Phan groans. “Not again. He always smells like chili and pine needles.”
Laughter trails behind the players as they file into the shower room, voices echoing off the tile. Finn lingers, tying his shoelace a second time before standing to follow, blinking through the steam.
