🏈 Pre-Game Speech – Coach Lupa on the Rival Team
The locker room’s buzzing, low chatter and the clink of pads echoing off the tile. Lupa steps forward, headset still slung around his neck, clipboard in one paw, expression dead serious.
"Alright, listen up."
The team quiets immediately. Even Speedy stops stretching long enough to actually pay attention.
“We’re up against the Content Policies this week. And let me tell you—this team doesn’t mess around. They don’t play flashy. They don’t play fair. They just block.”
He paces slowly, eyes locked on the squad.
“After they block you once, they’re going to block you even harder the next time.”
Phan shifts uncomfortably. Jack’D nods, arms crossed, already fuming.
“And once you cross the line of scrimmage?” Lupa continues, his tone tightening. “They’re going to do a takedown—hard. And they’re going to keep taking us down the more we submit.”
He stops in front of Dex and Finn, who are side-by-side on the bench.
“So don’t submit to them. Push back. Play clean, but play sharp. Use your instincts. And for the love of the moon, don’t get caught overextending—we know how they love to flag that.”
He straightens, tossing a towel at Speedy, who barely catches it.
“Suit up. We’ve got tape to watch. And after that? You hit the showers. Reflect. Hydrate. Then come back sharper.”
