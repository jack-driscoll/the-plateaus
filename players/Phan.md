# Phan

## Phan – #22 Overview

Species: Red Deer
Position: WR / Utility Back (WR/RB hybrid)
Role: Dex’s closest teammate, athletic wildcard, emotional spark of the team
Age: ~21
Vibe: Smooth, expressive, deceptively strong, and quick on the turn. Where Dex is quiet storm, Phan is sun through the trees—radiant, confident, connected.

## Visual Profile:

    Fur: Rich russet red with lighter tan underbelly and throat

    Build: Lean but powerful—like a 400m sprinter

    Arms: Short brown deer hair—fuzzy in a way that draws teasing from teammates

    Hair: A little longer than Dex’s, swept and tousled, naturally styled by wind and sweat

    Eyes: Gold-brown, bright, playful

    Antlers: Smaller than Dex’s, sleek, smooth, and asymmetrical (naturally)

    Expression: Half-smile, always on the verge of a wink or a comeback

    Posture: Relaxed shoulders, loose hips, bouncing on the balls of his hooves

## Uniform & Gear:

    Forest green jersey with #22, usually untucked after practice

    Compression shorts or BUD/S-style running shorts—he hates wearing long pants

    Carries his helmet under one arm, never clipped

    Gloves: Lightweight, extra fingertip grip, designed with deer hoof contouring

    Cleats: Bright green stripes more scuffed than Dex’s—Phan’s always cutting hard

    Wears a slim braided band around one ankle with three tiny pine beads

## Personality & Lore:

    Jokes constantly, but knows exactly when to drop into game mode

    Deeply loyal—would throw hands for Dex without question

    Loves music—always has a shared playlist going in the locker room

    Gets sentimental at weird times—might suddenly bring up a childhood memory mid-stretch

    On the field: His routes are fluid and improvisational—he finds the space Dex trusts is there

    Off the field: Known for running shirtless cool-down laps and spiking water bottles for fun

    Signature quote: “Cut sharp. Feel the wind bend.”

## Phan’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A tangled pair of white earbuds stuffed in a beat-up tin marked “Vibes”

        Half a protein bar, still in the wrapper (been there for a week)

        A folded bandana with red pine needles stuck to it

        A cracked Polaroid of him and Dex mid-laugh—some water damage, but he keeps it anyway

        His play sheet taped inside the door, drawn in comic-book panels instead of diagrams

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey crumpled but clean, half on the hook, half hanging off

        Helmet hanging from the strap by the face cage, with a sticker that says “DEER MODE”

        Shoulder pads askew like he threw them in after practice

        Small bluetooth speaker clipped to a carabiner—usually playing lo-fi or synth funk

        A single glove hung up with the other tossed somewhere below

        A pinecone balanced on the shelf edge—no explanation given

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats loose, slightly muddy, untied

        A rolled-up notebook labeled “Cut sharp / Feel the wind bend” with scribbled poems and routes

        Backup gloves with a chunk missing from the palm—he refuses to throw them out

        A stack of sports drink caps he’s been collecting for no reason

        A stick of incense and a lighter jammed between socks

    Back Wall of Locker:

        His flair patch: a swooping, carved spiral that resembles both wind and antlers

        Taped-up lyric scraps:

            “They never saw me / Just the blur”
            “It’s not the hands, it’s the soul”

        A tally of every touchdown where he hurdled someone—he draws them like tiny deer leaping fences
