# Fiachra

## Fiachra Overview
- Fiachra - #77, Raven
- Position: LT (Offense) / LB (Defense)
- Height: 6'5"
- Build: Long-limbed, lean but powerful—wingspan for days.


## Appearance:

-    Midnight-black feathers with a subtle violet-blue sheen in sunlight

-    Beak slightly curved, with a silver ring on the left side (symbol of mentorship)

-    Dark green uniform stretched over a broad frame, with wing-slit vents in the back of his jersey for airflow

-    Eye black under sharp eyes; sees plays unfolding three moves ahead

-    Tail feathers tied back with a leather cord—ritualistic, almost monk-like

## Personal Flair Patch:
-     A quill and hammer crossed—symbolizing intellect and strength in balance

## Gear:

-    Gauntlet-style gloves with feather texture woven in, excellent for grip and finesse

-    Shoulder pads slightly modified to avoid wing compression

-    Small pouch near his belt that carries slips of paper—play notes, mantras, maybe even tiny riddles

## Personality:

    - Teammates often go to him for advice—on football, life, or how to fix a jammed locker

    - May carry the team’s unofficial “Book of Wisdom”—a notebook passed down from player to player

    - Doesn’t yell. Doesn’t need to. When Fiachra speaks, everyone listens.
    
    - Aura: Scholarly bruiser. Speaks wisdom between pancake blocks.
