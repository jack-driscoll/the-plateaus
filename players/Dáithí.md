## Description
•	Height/Build: Shorter side, compact and quick—think wiry muscle, low center of gravity
•	Hair: Tousled sandy-blonde or curly light brown—windswept like he just ran a wind sprint
•	Eyes: Bright and alert—green or goldish, always scanning
•	Skin: Light with a bit of a ruddy, wind-chased glow—maybe a few freckles if you want to echo Cael/Rowan but distinct
•	Expression: Always half-grinning like he’s up to something
•	Style Flair: Taped wrists, one sock pulled higher than the other, maybe chews gum on the sideline
•	Gloves: Lightweight style, minimal padding, designed for speed
•	Number 62 big on the chest, maybe nicked and scuffed from scrimmages he shouldn’t have survived
