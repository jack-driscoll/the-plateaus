# Eoghan

## Eoghan – #76

Species: Black Bear (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Right Tackle (RT)
Height: 6'6"
Weight: 335 lbs
Build: Just as massive as Owen, but leaner through the waist—all torque, all bite
Fur: Deep black with a slight chestnut tint along the shoulders
Eyes: Sharp amber with a spark that never settles
Expression: Confident, animated—he talks, grins, and then bulldozes you
## Personality & Traits:

    The younger twin, but more vocal—jokes that he got all the charisma

    Fiery, outspoken, and fiercely loyal—if you mess with the Plateaus, you hear from Eoghan

    Plays with visible emotion: growls after pancakes, claps after long runs

    Aims to intimidate—uses eye contact and attitude like weapons

    Obsessed with footwork and finish—constantly tweaks his stance pre-snap

    Chants little phrases under his breath at the line: *“Anchor fast. Rip low. Snap.”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #76, always tucked tight with tape at the base

    Pants: White football pants with reinforced knees

    Gloves: Wide-palmed and clawed up—he goes through a new pair every few games

    Tape: Forearms wrapped with mirrored eye black designs—custom, almost tribal

    Chews mint leaves before every game and during warmups

    Flair Patch: Twin bear heads mirrored in profile, jaws open in defiance

## Aura on the Field:

    Brings energy to the line—he’ll slap helmets, yell encouragement, and run to the huddle

    Known to take on double-teams with a smile

    Once broke a defender’s morale by laughing mid-block

    Phan says: “You hear Eoghan coming. Then you’re under him.”

## Quote:

    “If it roars, I roar back.”

        A rolled-up towel with claw tears at both ends

        A pair of mirrored sunglasses, scratched but still reflective

        A laminated card titled “Pancake Count – This Season” with tally marks in red Sharpie

        Jersey #76 draped on the hook like it’s battle-worn

        Shoulder pads dented and loud-looking—sprayed with a red handprint symbol near the collar

        Helmet with claw marks near the back—decal of twin bear heads on the crown

        Gloves dangling from a carabiner—palms blown out from trench work

        A black-and-green towel tied like a cape behind the hook

        A stash of mint wrappers jammed into the corner behind the pads
