# Cael

## Cael – #14

Position: Wide Receiver 1 (WR1), Kick Returner 2 (KR2)
Species: Human (fey-touched / meadow spirit vibe)
Age: 21
Height: 6'0"
Build: Slender but athletic—like a wild thing made for open fields
Eyes: Moss green, often distant but never unfocused
Hair: Shaggy mop of brown hair, tousled and soft, always looks like the wind’s been in it
Skin: Fair with a ruddy warmth, often freckled and lightly sun-kissed
Jersey Fit: Wears #14 in a slightly looser cut—he doesn’t like feeling “taped in”
## Vibe & Movement:

    Graceful, unpredictable—moves with an untamed, natural rhythm

    Not a track sprinter—more like meadow spirit running routes

    Often has grass stains on his knees, and doesn’t seem to mind

    No helmet visor—he says he likes to see the sky clearly

    Good chemistry with Dex on timing routes—like they’re tuned to the same current

    Has a blade of grass behind his ear half the time without realizing it

## Personality:

    Lowkey spiritual, but never preachy—he listens more than he talks

    Writes poems on the bus rides, but never shows them

    Quietly cracks jokes at the perfect time

    Gives off wild garden energy—calm, clever, and just a little mysterious

    Can disappear into his thoughts mid-warmup, then snap back and torch a cornerback

## Gear & Symbolism:

    Cleats: Grass-stained and carefully laced

    Wristbands: Worn soft, one stitched with a spiral like tree rings

    Flair Patch: A soft green spiral with a trailing wind tail—movement through growth

    Quote (scrawled in pencil above his locker):

        “Routes aren’t run. They’re remembered.”

## Cael’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A small woven basket of dried clover and meadow grass

        A tin of herbal salve labeled “For bruises & thoughts”

        A tiny journal with a green felt cover, filled with poems, dreams, and route sketches (never shown to anyone)

        A pine twig bound with a thread (possibly a good luck charm)

        A folded strip of faded linen with a pressed flower inside

    Main Hook Area:

        His jersey (#14), hung loosely and slightly wrinkled

        Shoulder pads resting at an angle with one strap half undone

        Green helmet beneath, no visor

        A small bundle of white wristbands looped over the hook

        A single blade of grass tucked behind the helmet earhole

        A feather tucked into a crack near the back wall

        A soft humming wind chime made of wood and twine hanging from a carabiner

    Lower Compartment:

        A long, shallow box holding:

            A few pebbles

            Some acorns

            A small sewing kit

            His leather notebook

        Backup gloves wrapped in a cloth napkin

        A half-empty water bottle with “H20” scribbled on the label

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: a soft green spiral with a wind tail—movement through growth

        Quote scrawled in pencil:

            “Routes aren’t run. They’re remembered.”

        In the corner: a small drawing of a deer and a meadow with three stars above
