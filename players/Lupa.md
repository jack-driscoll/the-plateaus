# Lupa

## Lupa

Role: Defensive Coordinator
Species: Wolf (descendant of the Werewolves of Ossory)
Build: Tall, lean, wiry—like someone shaped by both battle and ritual
Fur: Gray with streaks of silver and shadow, thickest around the arms and neck
Eyes: Sharp green, intense and thoughtful—see too much, blink rarely
Voice: Calm, gravelly, measured—like someone who knows you’ll listen when it counts
Age: Unknown. Older than they look. Maybe ageless.
## Visual Profile:

    Arms: Fully furred, gray wolf arms with strong forearms and clawed fingers—barely hidden beneath rolled sleeves or tactical gear

    Clothing: Often wears a coach’s long over-the-ear headset with a boom mic

    Over that? A dark druidic green hoodie or sideline shell jacket—unmarked except for one glowing patch

    Sigil Patch: A glowing bright green (#1fff00) patch of druidic sigils, etched in clean lines over the outer left bicep

    Pants: Black tactical joggers or athletic pants with utility side-pockets

    Shoes: Tactical cleats—silent even on pavement

## Personality:

    Tactical, composed, speaks softly but leaves space for you to fill

    Has a deep respect for ritual—adjusts game plans by moon phase or wind shift if necessary

    Has been seen meditating at midfield after games—no one dares interrupt

    Treats players like a sacred pack, not assets

    Gets along especially well with Aidan, Fiachra, and Caolán—quiet mystics recognize each other

    Writes long chalk diagrams that look like spell circles until you realize they’re coverage schemes

## Reputation:

    Players say Lupa’s voice is “the kind that makes you stop moving when it cuts through the wind”

    Once made a Narc player false-start just by looking at him across the line

    Uses very few words—prefers symbols, nods, or short phrases like:

        “Shadows left. Collapse in. Echo 5.”

## Lore:

    Descended from the Werewolves of Ossory, a mystical and royal bloodline of warrior wolves in Irish legend

    His blood carries ancestral memory, and his tactics echo centuries of predatory instinct

    Doesn’t howl. Doesn’t need to. The team just knows when Lupa’s locked in

## Lupa’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A folded, matte-black sideline headset with a boom mic, perfectly coiled cord

        A leather-bound field journal, the pages filled with coverage diagrams that look like arcane circles

        A wooden box of white chalk sticks with one piece slightly glowing at the tip

        A black-and-silver pocket watch—silent, never ticking, always right

        A roll of dark green athletic tape with one word etched faintly: “Collapse”

    Main Hook Area:

        Druid-green sideline hoodie, faintly scorched near the hem

        A tactical longcoat hanging under the hoodie—lined with wolf runes

        Black joggers, rolled at the cuffs, one pocket torn at the seam and stitched with green thread

        On the inside of the locker door: a cloth patch sewn to the panel with bright green sigils (#1fff00), softly humming under certain lights

        Hanging from a carabiner: a cork cord charm strung with three beads—obsidian, yew, and bone

    Lower Compartment:

        Tactical cleats with silent soles, resting heel-first

        A rolled parchment scroll bound with deer sinew—likely unreadable to anyone but him

        A copper whistle, darkened with age

        An empty ceramic mug etched with a single line:

            “Let the shadows speak.”

        A set of defensive wristbands tagged with cryptic formations like “Void Net,” “Crush Vine,” and “Phantom C1”

        Small velvet pouch containing a single fang—possibly his own

         a bespoke compression underlayer woven with sigils and reinforced with hidden plate stitching Rumors swirl of it being made from spun yew fiber and tactical lycra.

    Back Wall:

        A minimalist wolf silhouette scratched into the metal—no flourish, just a shape

        A diagram pinned with faded tape labeled “Pack Collapse – Variant E”

        No quotes. No noise. Just intent

    Standard Issue:

        A vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, unopened, still in original packaging. He keeps it for reasons he hasn’t shared.
