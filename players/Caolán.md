# Caolán – #10

## Caolán – #10 Overview

- Position: Punter
- Species: Irish hare (longer ears, lankier limbs than a standard rabbit)
- Build: Lean, long-legged, all tendon and twitch muscle

## Personality: 
- Stoic, laser-focused, and spiritual in his own quiet way. Speaks in riddles. Barely blinks. Probably fasted for a week once just to feel “light enough to kick gravity.”

## Appearance:

-    Silvery brown fur, slightly tousled like he’s been running through fog

-    Wears his jersey (forest green #10) tucked perfectly, no wrinkles, no nonsense

-    Tape around his left ankle with a sigil etched in white chalk

-    Carries a small prayer stone in his locker shaped like a foot

-    Eyes like he sees the future… or at least the punt return lane before it opens

## Flair Patch: Crescent moon above a rabbit’s foot—symbol of fate and balance

## Kicking Style:

    Punts so precise they’re like dropping a stone into a cup of water

    His signature move is the “Moon Drop”—a spinning, slow-descending punt that confuses returners and hangs long enough for coverage to get there

    Once punted a ball so high it disappeared into the clouds. No one knows when it landed.
