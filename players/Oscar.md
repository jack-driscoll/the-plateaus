# Oscar

## Oscar – #21

Nickname: Jack’D (still used by teammates, but not official)
Species: Human
Position: Equipment Manager (and former player)
Age: 27
Number: 27
Height: 6'0"
Build: Muscular with a dense frame—like he’s been in more fights than he admits
Hair: Brown, spiked into a tight mohawk, sides shaved
Eyes: Brown with a permanent squint like he’s judging the fit of your cleats
Expression: Serious, unreadable, maybe even a little haunted—unless you talk gear
## Uniform & Gear:

    Wears Plateaus greens even off the field

    Gloves: Black with green flair, reinforced knuckles

    Cleats: Always polished—always

    Keeps his helmet spotless and covered like it’s sacred

    Wears the team hoodie open with his QR code on the shoulder

    His personal sigil: A bright green trefoil knot, often drawn on tape or etched on tools

## Personality:

    Quiet, deeply loyal, won’t say much—but you’ll feel it when he shows up

    Obsessed with proper fit, ritual prep, and mechanical efficiency

    He once stayed up all night to re-balance everyone’s helmet weight before a storm game

    Close with Dex, weirdly respectful of Faolán’s chaos

    Has a long history with the game—possibly played high-level ball before The Plateaus

    Gets teased for “being the locker room ghost” because he’s always just there

## Mythical Vibe:

    Name comes from “os cara” – “friend of the deer”

    In Irish mythology, Oscar is the son of Oisín and Niamh, and the grandson of Fionn mac Cumhaill

    Tied to ancient warriors, tragedy, and sacrifice—but he never brings it up

    Teammates say his locker is “more like a shrine”

## Quote:

    “If it breaks, I fix it. If it fits, I keep it. If it matters, I carry it.”
    "Don't need luck, I brought tools."

## Oscar’s Locker Layout

        A tightly folded Plateaus hoodie with his QR code visible on the shoulder

        A small bundle of sage and pine needles, ends charred

        A Polaroid of the team post-practice, pinned with a safety clip

        An old key on a worn green string

        A spare roll of athletic tape etched with a trefoil knot

        His #21 jersey, hung with near-military precision

        Cleats, wiped clean, hanging by the laces

        Towel hanging from a hook in a perfect triangle fold

        Green thread tied to the hook post

        A worn leather strap labeled “OSCAR”

    Lower Compartment:

        A smooth football, scuffed on one side

        Gloves laid palm-up, showing his totem patch

        An unlabeled hardbound spiral notebook with diagrams and cryptic notes

        A miniature wooden deer carved from driftwood

        A tin of balm labeled “Grip / Calm”
