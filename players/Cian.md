# Cian

## Cian – The Wizard Head Coach
🌿 Name Meaning:

Cian (pronounced Kee-an) is an ancient Irish name meaning “enduring one” or “ancient.” Fitting for a man whose playbook feels like it was written in tree bark and whispered through standing stones.
## 🎩 Visual Profile:

    Wears a dark green wizard robe with fitted sleeves and play-call pockets

    His wizard hat bears bright green druidic sigils (#1fff00) and comes in two versions:

        One with a brown base (earth wisdom)

        One with a dark green base (field strategy)

    Carries a twisted wooden staff with a glowing green orb encased in living branches

    Wears cleats beneath the robe—he’s still got moves

## 📖 Aura & Command Style:

    Speaks in a calm, steady tone that makes entire rooms quiet

    Never panics. Ever. Timeouts feel like meditation retreats under his guidance

    Known for giving cryptic but motivating halftime speeches, like:

        “The river flows where the stone breaks. Be the river.”

## 🧠 Tactical Genius

    Invented formations like the “Stag Shift,” the “Fog Fang Zone,” and the elusive “Spiral Stunt”

    Rumored to script the first 13 plays of every game during full moons only

    Reads defensive schemes like ancient runes—and they respond

## 🕊️ Legacy Vibes

    Was once spotted in the woods speaking to Ailill’s rabbit

    Jack’D swears he levitated a blocking sled once during summer camp

    Phan believes he sleeps standing up

    Kitten? Kitten won’t say a word. Just makes a warding gesture and changes the subject
