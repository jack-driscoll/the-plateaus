# Fintan

## Fintan – #?? (unlisted)

Species: Unicorn (Polygonal Construct)
Position: Backup Quarterback (Hidden Depth)
Build: Lanky and angular, all sharp edges and impossible geometry
Height: Uncertain—people swear he shifts sizes between huddles
Eyes: No one’s sure. Some say they glow green through slits. Some say there’s nothing there.
Head: A blocky, low-poly 3D unicorn mask, faceted like a prism—gleams under stadium light
Jersey: Always appears with a jersey that reads "Hurricanes"—no one knows why, or whose it was
## Personality & Traits:

    Appears only in moments of absolute chaos—third string disaster strikes, and suddenly he’s warming up

    Speaks in riddles. Or code. Or possibly not at all.

    Throws with immaculate spiral, unreadable release, and strange curve logic

    Wears no helmet—only the polygonal unicorn mask, which no one can remove

    Seems to know the entire playbook, past, present, and future variations

    Rumors swirl that Coach Cian summoned him during a lightning storm using an encrypted Druid app

## On the Field:

    Perfect passer rating—but there are no official stats

    Wears number 17, but it never appears on team rosters

    Has a signature rollout move where the camera loses him for half a second

    Once reversed a fumble into a touchdown via “loopback motion”—even the refs were afraid to question it

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Deep green Plateaus-style… but with another team’s name sewn into the seam

    Pants: White with gold-stitched spiral patterns—shimmer only in moonlight

    Cleats: Flat-black, hoof-shaped soles—leave behind no visible turf marks

    Flair Patch: Unknown—patch changes every time you look

    Quote:

        “White fire remembers.”

## Team Status:
Officially unlisted. Unofficially: everyone knows not to talk about Fintan unless the lights flicker.

## Locker Layout:
Highly classified
