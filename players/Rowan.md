# Rowan

## Rowan – #11 Overview

Species: Human
Position: Wide Receiver 2 (WR2)
Age: 20
Height: 5'8"
Build: Lean, quick, all nerve and spark—like someone who lives just ahead of the snap
Hair: Bright red, messy and windswept
Skin: Fair with freckles, especially across his nose and shoulders
Eyes: Hazel with flares of gold—intense when he locks into a route
## Vibe & Movement:

    Fast, twitchy, and always moving—even when standing still

    His warmup routines look like fight choreography

    Built for hard cuts and comeback routes, but has serious burst when he’s ignored

    Trains his head fakes in the mirror. Tracks his own shoulder lean like a sculptor

    Never wears sleeves, even when it’s cold

    Has a slight chip on his shoulder—wants you to underestimate him

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #11, cut high for max freedom

    Cleats: Lightweight with graphite heel inserts—custom for speed

    Gloves: Standard issue with extra grip added by Sprocket in post-practice tweaks

    Wristband on right arm, always with something scribbled in pen—usually “breathe” or “run past him”

    Flair Patch: A flaming branch, symbolizing speed, rebirth, and lighting up the field

## Personality & Lore:

    Talks fast, thinks faster—especially in route trees and misdirect setups

    Dex trusts him on sharp slants and corner fades—Rowan lives in the red zone

    Still learning patience—wants the ball every play

    Bickers with Phan like a younger brother, but they respect each other’s cuts

    Has a superstitious habit of tapping his helmet twice before every snap

    Sometimes sings under his breath at the line—nobody knows the tune

## Quote:

    “Burn it, or leave it unlit.”

## Rowan’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A crumpled box of protein bars with only the mint ones left

        A small roll of athletic tape with scorch marks on the edges

        A pair of busted earbuds in a cracked case labeled “Speed Lab”

        A laminated photo of a game-winning toe-tap catch—he circled his foot with red marker

        A half-finished Rubik’s cube and a note next to it that reads: “Not today.”

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #11, hung loose and slightly off-center

        Shoulder pads with tape marks where he “adjusts grip zones” mid-practice

        Helmet hanging by the chin strap, two subtle finger dents near the crown—his tap ritual

        Cleats stuffed with dryer sheets (Rowan swears it makes him faster)

        Right wristband hanging with “breathe” sharpied on it

        A mesh drawstring bag with backup gloves, one singed at the palm

        A cracked mirror shard wedged in the side with marker scribble: “See fire.”

    Lower Compartment:

        A stack of scorched route cards—corners singed, some drawn over in red

        A wrapped set of backup socks with flames drawn on the toes

        A pocket notebook full of play timing notes, quotes, and “burn reads”

        Two lighters, only one works

        A small piece of turf, scorched and taped to the bottom—he claims it’s from a “breakaway moment”

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, stuffed behind the lighters and backup gloves

        2000s era Bike Swimmer jockstrap, never washed for luck - he layers

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: Flaming branch, stitched and slightly singed at the edge

        Quote written in blocky Sharpie:

            “Burn it, or leave it unlit.”

        A hand-sketched diagram of a play he’s never shown the coaches—titled “Flash 11”
