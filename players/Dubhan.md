# Dubhán

## Dubhán – #64

Species: Human
Position: Right Guard (RG)
Height: 6'2"
Weight: 305 lbs
Build: Dense, low-set, with forearms like old tree roots and a neck built for bracing
Hair: Jet black, undercut with a single braid that falls down one side
Eyes: Deep brown, nearly black—still and unreadable
Skin: Olive-toned with coal dust freckles on his hands and arms
Expression: Withdrawn, inward-facing—seems like he’s always listening to something deeper than voices
## Personality & Traits:

    The “little dark one” of the line—not because he’s small, but because he moves through stillness

    Superstitious but subtle—whispers old prayers in Irish before each snap

    Rarely speaks unless necessary; communicates with glances, posture, and pressure

    Considered one of the best hand fighters on the team—trained by his grandfather in stonework

    Has a strange sense for danger—calls out incoming stunts before they happen

    Always finds the one cracked tile in any locker room and stands on it barefoot before the game

## On the Field:

    Blocks like a moving slab of peatstone—absorbs impact, then redirects force

    Doesn’t go looking for pancakes—lets defenders crash into their own collapse

    Appears slow at first, but always in the right place, exactly in time

    Eyes locked straight ahead—never looks at the defender until contact

    Wears black eye paint—only during home games

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #64, darkened by sweat and dirt before warmup’s over

    Pants: Slightly baggy at the thighs for freedom of stance work

    Gloves: Worn at the fingers—he cuts the pads to feel through his knuckles

    Flair Patch: A buried cairn with a raven feather, symbolizing silence, memory, and hidden strength

## Quote:

    “Some things are meant to be unmoved.”

## Dubhán’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A tightly folded black cloth wrap, edge stitched with a spiral knot

        A small jar of coal ash, smudged around the rim—used before games

        A paper packet of salt and crushed bark tied with string

        A chipped ceramic figurine of a buried cairn, set in the back left corner

        A folded prayer cloth, once white, now gray at the edges

        A weathered matchbook with a raven emblem, three matches remain

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #64 folded inward like armor, hung with intentional weight

        Helmet resting on its crown—inside, a slip of parchment with a hand-inked spiral

        Gloves with cut knuckle pads, draped over the shoulder pad hook

        Shoulder pads leaned gently to the side on the lower shelf—never dropped, always placed

        A charm cord braided with black thread, bone bead, and an old button

        Black forearm wraps hanging like old bandages—dried earth clinging to the cuffs

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats brushed clean but faded—each with a rune carved into the heel tab

        A block of chalked limestone with finger pits worn into it

        A folded gray towel with deep stitching in the corner: “Stand still. Stand firm.”

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, packed neatly in a dark muslin pouch

        A pressed leaf inside a plastic case—an oak leaf, nearly fossilized

        A backup chinstrap, coiled like a binding cord

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: A buried cairn with a raven feather, etched into leather and affixed with metal studs

        Quote burned into the wood with slow precision:

            “Some things are meant to be unmoved.”

        Faint soot smudges and a single spiral rune drawn in charcoal
