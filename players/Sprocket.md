# Sprocket

## Sprocket

Species: Raccoon (Anthropomorphic)
Role: Equipment Manager, sideline strategist, multitool of mayhem
Height: 4'11"
Weight: 84 lbs
Build: Scrappy, wiry, fast-twitch kinetic energy bundled in a hoodie
Fur: Dark charcoal with gray markings, tail always swaying like it’s clocking time
Eyes: Electric amber, constantly scanning, calculating gear-to-grit ratios
Expression: Sharp grin, grease-smudged forehead, and goggles perched above his brow
## Personality & Traits:

    Tactical genius of gear logistics—knows where every piece of tape, cleat, and chinstrap lives

    Talks faster than most people think

    Refers to himself as “Chief Operations Officer, Field-Ready Division”—but never with a straight face

    Has at least three tools in his pockets at all times

    Keeps a weatherproof field binder with repair contingencies for helmets, cleats, and sudden fires

    Teammates swear he once fixed a cracked facemask with a paperclip and sheer will mid-game

## Special Skills:

    Can lace a cleat in five seconds flat

    Modified the team’s ball pump to double as a sideline pressure gauge and radio scanner

    Installed secret pouches in multiple players' lockers—“don’t ask which ones”

    Rides a gas-powered scooter around the practice field named “Gritwheel”

    Carries a slingshot. Hasn’t said why.

## Uniform & Gear:

    Usually seen in a Plateaus green utility hoodie with way too many pockets

    Wears a custom tool belt, part mechanic, part wizard

    Fingerless gloves, cut from an old pair of Dex’s discarded ones

    Flair Patch: A gear surrounded by stars, symbolizing problem-solving and midnight breakthroughs

    Favorite saying when something breaks:

        “Give me ten seconds, a zip tie, and belief.”

## Quote:

    “It’s not broken. It’s just dramatically improvising.”

## Sprocket’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A dented tin labeled “Emergency Solutions (Tier 2)”—contains zip ties, an old whistle, and a multi-tool with half the bits missing

        A laminated field diagram with notes scrawled in four colors of dry-erase marker

        A half-eaten protein bar wedged inside a repurposed mouthguard case

        A beat-up walkie-talkie, covered in duct tape with the name “GRITCOM” sharpied on the side

        A tiny solar-powered fan, clipped onto the shelf with a bent binder clip

    Main Hook Area:

        A child-sized Plateaus green hoodie, sleeves scorched at the cuffs, tool loops stitched into the hem

        A custom tool belt hanging from a hanger like sacred armor

        Goggles dangling by one earstrap, permanently fogged on one side

        Fingerless gloves, patched with mismatched scraps from other players’ gear

        A dangling pouch labeled “Triage Tape”—contents unknown

        A lanyard with five mini-wrenches, a safety pin medallion, and one coin from an arcade that shut down in 2009

    Lower Compartment:

        A socket wrench wedged into the drain channel like it lives there

        A small rubber duck wearing a Plateaus helmet—name tag: “Brigadier”

        A metal case with emergency helmet clips, boot spikes, and two lighters (neither working)

        A mess of jumbled shoelaces, most frayed, some tied together

        A team-issued Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, unopened, stuffed behind a rag

        A tiny cooler labeled “DO NOT TOUCH (unless halftime)”—contents mysterious

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A gear surrounded by stars, sharp-stitched with reflective thread

        Quote scratched in jagged stylus lines:

            “It’s not broken. It’s just dramatically improvising.”

        Below that: a tally marked “field fixes without tools” – at least 27 and counting
