## Personality & Traits:

    Rarely seen without a half-smoked cigar and a lopsided smirk

    Lives and operates out of the Chicago poker underworld—known for pulling players from card tables, dice games, and midnight scrimmages in abandoned warehouses

    Calls everyone “kid” or “champ,” even the coaches

## Special Skills:

    Expert at spotting untapped, “uncoachable” talent—makes sense of chaos

    Negotiates like a con artist, but for your soul instead of your signature

    Fluent in four types of backroom slang

    Can smell a 4.4 forty from across a blackjack table

    Runs a side game called “Bench Warmers & Broken Promises” for charity—maybe

## Flair Patch:

    A pair of playing cards crossed with a cat’s claw, stitched in red and midnight thread

## Quote:

    “Kid, there’s two kinds of players—ones who want it, and ones who don’t know I’m watching.”
