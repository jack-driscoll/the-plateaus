# Fionn

## Fionn – #33

Full Name: Fionn McCool (yes, that Fionn)
Species: Human (mythic lineage)
Position: Running Back (RB1) / Backup Free Safety (FS)
Lore Tie: Son of Oisín, descended from the Fianna, bearer of ancient Irish wisdom. His origin story draws from the Salmon of Knowledge—he gained insight, foresight, and immense awareness after tasting the salmon’s skin.
## Visual Profile

    Hair: Jet black, tousled and a little wild—looks like he woke from a vision mid-sprint

    Eyes: Piercing blue, like clear water reflecting the sky—unsettling in their clarity

    Skin: Pale/fair with a slight glow under stadium lights

    Build: Wiry but muscular—like a distance runner forged from rope and sinew

    Ears: Slightly pointed, hinting at his otherworldly bloodline

    Expression: Calm, collected, observant—but there's a storm underneath

    Posture: Balanced and alert—never flat-footed, always centered like a druid ready to dodge lightning

## Uniform & Gear

    Jersey: Dark green #33, pristine before kickoff, always stained by end of 1st quarter

    Cleats: Old, scratched, but still fly—rumor has it he never bought them; they “found him”

    Gloves: Standard Plateaus slate-gray gloves with subtle blue swirl patterns at the cuff

    Wrist Tape: Wrapped on both wrists with faded ogham symbols traced in marker

    Flair Patch: A silver fishhook intertwined with a stream—a nod to the Salmon of Knowledge

## Personality & Traits

    Wise beyond his years—players often forget he’s just 20

    Doesn’t speak much but always knows

    Occasionally zones out staring into space mid-practice—then rips off a 70-yard run without blinking

    Has a poetic way of explaining play strategy (e.g., “The hole is a moment. Not a place.”)

    Wears no headphones during warmups—he says he listens to the hum of the field

    quote: "watch out for Doppler 5000!"

## Fionn’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A smooth river stone carved with a salmon and ogham script—his personal totem

        A folded linen cloth with ash streaks (from some ritual? No one’s asked)

        A single glove tucked inside an old leather-bound notebook

        A hard copy of Beowulf, spine cracked, full of sticky notes

        A small cork vial labeled “Hill Spring – Beltane” with a few drops of water inside

    Main Hook Area:

        His jersey (#33), perfectly folded in half, then hung like a monk’s robe

        Shoulder pads shaped just right, slightly faded from sun and time

        His cleats sit side by side beneath—scratched, but never muddy

        A hanging strip of turf nailed to the side—“taken from the field the day he broke free”

        A thin silver chain dangling from the hook with a worn pewter medallion of a salmon

        A well worn vintage Bike #10 jockstrap

    Lower Compartment:

        A sealed pouch with snacks labeled in Gaelic (no one’s sure what’s inside)

        Wrist tape with ogham and sigils hand-marked before every game

        A hand-written play journal with entries that read more like riddles than diagrams

        A backup mouthguard etched with tiny stars and fish scales

        A folded green towel that smells faintly of cedar

    Back Wall:

        His flair patch: A silver fishhook curved through a flowing stream

        A chalk circle with symbols inside—redrawn every game

        A single quote written in slanted handwriting:

            “Watch out for Doppler 5000!”
            (No one knows what it means, but everyone’s heard him shout it mid-sprint.)
