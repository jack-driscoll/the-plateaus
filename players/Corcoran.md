## Personality & Traits:

    The Plateaus’ enforcer—brings intimidation, but it’s controlled, focused

    Known for giving short, growly speeches in the huddle right before a big stop

    Mentors younger defenders by bullying them slightly less than the others

    Jokes that he was “raised in a weight room with a whistle”

    Has a code of honor: “Never hit a man late, but hit him so he thinks it was.”

    Grew up on special teams—still loves kickoff like it’s the first hunt of the day

## On the Field:

    Plays in the box like a linebacker, but still fast enough to drop deep when needed

    Hits with intent—clean but full-speed

    Loud communicator—makes the defense feel louder when he’s on the field

    Has a sixth sense for screens and misdirection plays

    Once knocked a pulling guard off his cleats and then helped him up with a “Good pull, mate.”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #45, always stained and tight through the shoulders

    Gloves: Extra padding across the back knuckles, fingers custom-cut for flexibility

    Cleats: Chunky and worn—built more like boots

    Tape: Forearms fully wrapped, often drawn with runes or play notes

    Flair Patch: A boar skull surrounded by antlers, symbolizing relentless pursuit and primal power

## Quote:

    “I don’t chase the ball. I chase the moment it stops mattering.”

## Corcoran’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A barbell collar used as a paperweight

        A black tin labeled “Chalk & Consequences”—holds lifting chalk and a rosary

        A taped-up Ziploc bag of protein mix labeled “Third Down Dust”

        A folded towel with sweat-stained corners and “45” stitched into the edge

        A cracked ceramic boar figurine (from his sister, he says—he doesn’t elaborate)

        A beat-up pocket notebook of hit points—not stats, just moments

        A cracked photo of his high school team

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #45 hung taut over an angular wire hanger

        Shoulder pads smeared with green paint and claw marks (unknown origin)

        Helmet with scratch marks near the facemask and a boar skull decal on the back plate

        Gloves cut open at the index fingers for “feel”, dried blood still on one

        Forearm tape wraps stuffed into the corner, inked with runes and callouts

        A pouch of smelling salts tucked into the helmet shell

    Lower Compartment:

        Two pairs of cleats—one muddy, one clean, both labeled “BOOM LEFT” and “BOOM RIGHT”

        A box of meal bars (mostly meat and oats), half-smashed

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, balled up next to a cracked plastic protective cup

        A steel flask engraved with an antler silhouette—no one’s ever seen him drink from it

        A packet of cold packs and a used wrap 

        A taped hand mirror—taped because it broke during a warmup... and he taped it back together

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: Boar skull surrounded by antlers, stitched in red and bone thread

        Quote etched with a knife into the metal:

            “I don’t chase the ball. I chase the moment it stops mattering.”

        A chalk tally of how many plays he “ended” that week—reset every game
