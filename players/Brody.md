# Brody

## Brody (Full Name TBD)

Jersey Number: (TBD — suggest one?)
Position: Backup Wide Receiver (WR), also plays Rugby
Species: Human
Age: 18
Height: 5'11"
Build: Lean, wiry strength — built like a rugby player who’s been through it and come out scrappy
Hair: Tousled light brown, usually a little messy but charming
Eyes: Blue with mischief in them
Clothing Style: Rugby shorts and tank tops off the field, prefers easy movement, always barefoot if he can get away with it
Gloves: Green and black football gloves
Helmet: Wears the official Plateaus helmet with the team logo
Expression: A smirk that borders on trouble; eyes that say “I’ve seen shit, but let’s make a joke about it anyway.”
## Personality

    Core Vibe: Spunky, chaotic sunshine energy

    Humor: Nonstop—uses jokes and physical comedy to keep the mood light, especially when things get heavy

    Defense Mechanism: Deflection via goofiness

    Strength: Resilience and adaptability

    Weakness: Emotional vulnerability masked with constant cheer

    Quote: “What’s a little trauma between brothers, huh? C’mon, let’s tackle something.”

## Backstory

    Childhood: Grew up rough, bounced through unstable homes or environments—learned early to rely on himself and keep things upbeat to survive

    Reunion: Met his older brother Sean for the first time in 17 years. It was awkward, emotional, and ultimately kind of awesome

    Current Living Situation: Crashing at Sean’s apartment. Eats too many pancakes. Leaves socks everywhere.

## Relationship with Sean

    Status: Estranged brothers now reconnecting

    Dynamic:

        Brody teases and pokes fun to get Sean to loosen up

        Sean is low-key obsessed with protecting him

        Brody’s past makes Sean more emotional than he admits

    Conflict: Brody’s independence vs Sean’s overprotectiveness

    Potential Arc: They learn to trust each other and build a bond not just of blood, but of chosen brotherhood

## Extra Notes

    Plays rugby like a demon. Fast, unpredictable, and fearless.

    Probably the kind of guy who drinks milk straight from the jug and pretends to be innocent when caught

    Keeps a photo of him and Sean in his locker—even though he pretends it’s “just in case he needs blackmail material”

## Brody’s Locker – Jersey #86
Top Shelf:

    A crumpled paper bag of gummy worms, half open, sharing space with protein bars

    A rugby ball signed by his old team back home, duct-taped from a split seam

    A tiny Polaroid of Sean trying to look serious (Brody drew bunny ears on it)

    A video game controller—“for focus,” he insists

    A wrinkled note on lined paper that just says “You’re not broken, just scrambled eggs. Love you anyway.”

Main Hook Area:

    Jersey #86 is half-fallen off the hook and somehow inside out

    Shoulder pads hung lopsided with stickers on the straps (one says “SLAY”, another is a cracked heart)

    Plateaus green helmet with a bandaid stuck to the facemask—unclear if it’s for a crack or just Brody being Brody

    A small drawing of him and Sean, done in crayon on the back of a play diagram

    A yellow slap bracelet that says “BRUV MODE: ON” wrapped around the hook

    His green and black WR gloves tucked into the helmet, one glove slightly chewed (???)

Lower Compartment:

    A pile of clean and dirty socks indistinguishably mixed

    Boxers with comic book sound effects (like “BAM!” and “POW!”)

    A vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, clearly borrowed from Sean and never returned

    A sealed bag of pancakes (??) labeled “Emergency Brody Fuel”

    A scruffed-up journal with scribbles like:

        “Play hard / Love harder / No crying in football unless you score real good”

        A whole page that just says “Sean’s cool. Don’t tell him I said that.”

Back Wall:

    Flair Patch: A cracked heart wrapped in lightning bolts

    Quote in marker: “Break the cycle. Not the vibe.”

    Doodles of himself in superhero poses and one note that says “Brody Time > Sad Time”

    A duct-taped pocket mirror with “U GOT THIS” written on the glass in Sharpie

## 🧷 Brody's Locker – WR #83

Theme: Chaotic gamer-jock energy with sentimental undertones.
🔝 Top Shelf

    Crumpled Plateaus practice beanie with a Reddit alien pin

    Tangle of cords (earbuds, phone charger, a mystery HDMI cable)

    Empty BRAWNDO bottle with "#buffed" scribbled on the label

    Roll of wrist tape with scribbles: 83, LOL, and a doodle of a football

    A half-folded paper labeled: "Account Recovery Code"

🧥 Main Hook Area

    Plateaus dark green jersey #83 hanging loose, slightly wrinkled

    Shoulder pads with a Post-it stuck to them: "YOU GOT THIS - SEAN"

    Cleats hanging from laces, one still caked in mud

    A Bike #10 jockstrap looped over the hook, #21 scrawled in black sharpie across the waistband

    A small, well-loved plush deer, one ear frayed and neck stitched up

🔽 Lower Compartment

    Worn pair of gray jeans, tangled with a white tank top

    PS5 controller missing one joystick cap

    Brody's notebook—filled with play routes, memes, and a "Things To Ask Sean" list

    A single pancake in a ziplock, dated but still present

    His locker charm: a tiny pixel-art magnet that reads “Respawn: 0:10”

🧱 Back Wall Flair Patch

    A pixel heart with a red loading bar beneath it

    Quote written in chalk:

        “If it’s posted, I’ve seen it.”
