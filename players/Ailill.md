# Ailill

## 🐇 Ailill (#12) – Backup Holder
## Visual Profile

Ailill stands 5'6" with a willowy build and curly light brown hair that dances gently around his pronounced, almost fae-like features. His hazel eyes carry warmth and a sense of being deeply in tune with the world. Pointed ears peek subtly from his hair, hinting at his elf lineage. His movements are graceful, as though gravity only loosely applies to him. There’s a deep calm to him, but a spark of quiet humor as well—like he knows things the rest of the team hasn’t figured out yet.
Uniform and Gear

Ailill wears jersey number 12, signifying intuition and a mystical touch. His Plateaus uniform mirrors the standard: dark green jersey, white pants with a green stripe, and solid green socks that reach mid-calf. His gloves are slender, finger-tipped, and sage-colored, optimized for a holder’s grip and laced with vine-like stitching. His shoulder pads are smaller, reinforced with extra cloth comfort patches that smell faintly of pine. He carries a worn leather pouch with dried clover, and his flair patch is a silver rabbit outlined by a crescent moon and antlers. His BRAWNDO bottle has a hand-wrapped leather grip and the words “Be Gentle, Be Ready” written in ogham runes near the base.
