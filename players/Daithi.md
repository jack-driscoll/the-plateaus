## Dáithí – #62

Species: Human
Position: Nickelback (NB)
Age: 20
Height: 5'9"
Weight: 172 lbs
Hair: Tousled sandy-brown, never fully tamed
Eyes: Bright green—sharp and glinting like a trickster in mid-move
Skin: Light with a ruddy glow from constant movement and sun exposure
Expression: Permanent sly half-grin, as if he just dodged something (or someone)
## Personality & Traits:

    Compact, clever, and built for disruption

    Treats every play like a personal dare—if you challenge him, he will bite

    Refers to Jack’D as “Coach D.” Nobody knows why, but it stuck

    Known for unexpected blitzes and sneaky coverage shifts

    Talks just enough trash to unnerve QBs—but never gets flagged

    Quickest reflexes on the team, especially when baiting routes

    Can’t sit still unless he’s asleep. Possibly even fidgets then.

## On the Field:

    Nickelback duties mean slot WRs hate him—he presses with attitude

    Excellent at disguising blitzes and baiting throws

    Often keeps a fingertip on the ground pre-snap like he’s listening to it

    Phan once called him “a deer tick with cleats and secrets”

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #62, always slightly loose like he borrowed it

    Gloves: Lightweight and grippy—he tapes the tips for extra feel

    Pants: Standard white with one sock always slightly lower than the other, his pants are always dirty

    Cleats: Scuffed but clean, with elastic laces

    Flair Patch: A fox head silhouette, stitched in green over a black spiral—agile, cunning, coiled for action

## Quote:

    “You blink, I’m gone.”

## Dáithí’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A roll of neon-orange wrist tape, half-unraveled

        A folded sports page with a red circle around an interception he made last season

        A plastic baggie full of mismatched wristbands—no pair ever matches

        A dented can of energy drink labeled “ZAPWATT”

        A miniature rubber fox toy with bite marks in the tail

        A pair of backup laces knotted like a trick cord

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #62 dangling from one corner, looks borrowed even though it’s his

        Shoulder pads hanging sideways, one strap always undone

        Helmet hanging face-down by the chinstrap—inside lined with play-call codes

        Gloves jammed in the face mask, fingers chewed at the tips

        Cleats kicked into the side of the locker, still dirty from last practice

        One white sock neatly folded. One… not.

    Lower Compartment:

        A scuffed dry-erase board with scribbled route traps

        A beat-up notebook labeled “Reads / Breaks / Gut Feels”

        A stack of used athletic tape strips—some with play names, others just doodles

        A granola bar half-wrapped in foil

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, slung over the divider with no shame

        A small vial of chalk dust—no one knows why

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: Fox head silhouette stitched over a black spiral

        Quote drawn in smudged permanent marker:

            “You blink, I’m gone.”

        A thin line of tally scratches, counting… something. He won’t say what.
