## Liam – #98

Species: American Bison (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Defensive Tackle (DT)
Height: 6'5"
Weight: 360 lbs
Build: Massive and immovable—built like a cathedral with legs
Fur: Deep, earthy brown with a darker ruff around his shoulders and neck
Eyes: Soft, contemplative dark brown—but they narrow the moment a play begins
Expression: Serene but focused, carries the calm of mountains and the strength of storms
## Personality & Traits:

    Gentle, deeply spiritual off the field—moves with purpose and reverence

    Often found standing silently by trees or fence posts before practice

    Speaks slowly, with wisdom and weight—team calls him “The Quiet Stop”

    Fiercely protective of younger players and prone to offering grounding advice

    Wears a druidic medallion under his jersey, never explains it

    When he hits, it’s like tectonic plates shifting

## On the Field:

    Fills double teams without blinking—sinks into the line like roots into earth

    Doesn’t chase sacks—just collapses space until the play dies

    Known for pausing at the snap, as if communing with the ground before exploding forward

    Once stopped a goal line surge by planting both hooves and just refusing to move

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #98, fits like it was grown, not sewn

    Pants: White with thick grass stains up the thighs

    Gloves: Extra-wide, reinforced palm, stitched with leather and cord

    Cleats: Custom-widened for hooved support and stomp strength

    Flair Patch: A mountain crest wrapped in a circle of runes—symbolizing stillness and power

## Quote:

    “They fall when the earth decides.”

## Liam’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A smooth river stone with a spiral worn into it from thumb rubs

        A folded wool cloth with a handful of dried prairie grass tied with twine

        A leather pouch containing soil from home—never opened since arrival

        A handwritten note from Coach Cian:

            “Hold the line, hold the peace.”

        A tin of balm labeled “Earthbone Blend – Joint Calm”

    Main Hook Area:

        Jersey #98, neatly folded over one thick wooden hanger

        Shoulder pads hanging with reinforced leather straps and chalk scuffs

        Helmet resting on a padded hook—no decals, just a faint groove shaped like a mountain ridge

        Gloves hanging palm-out, stitched with brown cord lacing

        A druidic medallion on a leather cord, looped through a carabiner

        A wrist wrap with runic stitching, marked with tally lines from game starts

    Lower Compartment:

        Cleats positioned heel-in, mud crusted into the toe seams

        A folded towel marked with hoof prints from the field

        A small jar of herbal resin labeled “For knees. For grounding.”

        A soft pouch containing a carved wooden totem in the shape of a mountain

        A laminated card with blocking calls and meditation cues

        A vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, hanging from one of the hooks

        A spare chinstrap, slightly cracked but carefully preserved

    Back Wall:

        Flair patch: Mountain crest wrapped in a circle of runes

        Quote chalked in thick, steady lines:

            “They fall when the earth decides.”

        A faint outline of a hoofprint and spiral, brushed into the corner like a blessing
