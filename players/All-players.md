# Ailill

## 🐇 Ailill (#12) – Backup Holder
## Visual Profile

Ailill stands 5'6" with a willowy build and curly light brown hair that dances gently around his pronounced, almost fae-like features. His hazel eyes carry warmth and a sense of being deeply in tune with the world. Pointed ears peek subtly from his hair, hinting at his elf lineage. His movements are graceful, as though gravity only loosely applies to him. There’s a deep calm to him, but a spark of quiet humor as well—like he knows things the rest of the team hasn’t figured out yet.
Uniform and Gear

Ailill wears jersey number 12, signifying intuition and a mystical touch. His Plateaus uniform mirrors the standard: dark green jersey, white pants with a green stripe, and solid green socks that reach mid-calf. His gloves are slender, finger-tipped, and sage-colored, optimized for a holder’s grip and laced with vine-like stitching. His shoulder pads are smaller, reinforced with extra cloth comfort patches that smell faintly of pine. He carries a worn leather pouch with dried clover, and his flair patch is a silver rabbit outlined by a crescent moon and antlers. His BRAWNDO bottle has a hand-wrapped leather grip and the words “Be Gentle, Be Ready” written in ogham runes near the base.

Eyes: Pale hazel with a flicker of lunar glow when he’s mid-punt

## Personality & Traits:

    Stoic and focused to the point of unnerving—teammates say he can meditate through a thunderstorm

    Speaks in riddles or oddly timed metaphors that somehow make sense later

    Known for uncanny awareness of wind, pressure, and distance—“He doesn't aim, he harmonizes”

    Often seen stretching in strange poses in the shadows or drawing spirals into turf

    Carries a deep spiritual aura, more shrine guardian than athlete

    Close with Lupa and Aidan—the mystics recognize their own

## On the Field:

    Signature Move: The Moon Drop—a perfectly timed, high-hanging punt that seems to disappear

    Once punted a ball so high during practice it vanished into the clouds.
    No one knows when it landed.

    Quietly competitive. Doesn’t chase glory—but will win field position wars with silence

    Team believes his kicks are predictive, not reactive

## Caolán – #10 Overview

- Position: Punter
- Species: Irish hare (longer ears, lankier limbs than a standard rabbit)
- Build: Lean, long-legged, all tendon and twitch muscle

## Personality: 
- Stoic, laser-focused, and spiritual in his own quiet way. Speaks in riddles. Barely blinks. Probably fasted for a week once just to feel “light enough to kick gravity.”

-    Wears his jersey (forest green #10) tucked perfectly, no wrinkles, no nonsense

-    Tape around his left ankle with a sigil etched in white chalk

## Flair Patch: Crescent moon above a rabbit’s foot—symbol of fate and balance

## Kicking Style:

    Punts so precise they’re like dropping a stone into a cup of water

    His signature move is the “Moon Drop”—a spinning, slow-descending punt that confuses returners and hangs long enough for coverage to get there

    Once punted a ball so high it disappeared into the clouds. No one knows when it landed.

    Wears cleats beneath the robe—he’s still got moves

## 📖 Aura & Command Style:

    Speaks in a calm, steady tone that makes entire rooms quiet

    Never panics. Ever. Timeouts feel like meditation retreats under his guidance

        “The river flows where the stone breaks. Be the river.”

## 🧠 Tactical Genius

    Invented formations like the “Stag Shift,” the “Fog Fang Zone,” and the elusive “Spiral Stunt”

    Rumored to script the first 13 plays of every game during full moons only

    Reads defensive schemes like ancient runes—and they respond

## 🕊️ Legacy Vibes

    Was once spotted in the woods speaking to Ailill’s rabbit

    Hits with intent—clean but full-speed

- Personality: Hyper-loyal, unpredictable, sharp-witted, and constantly twitchy. Faolán is the kind of receiver who seems to glitch between frames—defenders lose track of him not because he’s faster than them, but because he seems to rewire space on the fly.

-    Fierce loyalty: He’ll block for his teammates with all 38 lbs of determined squirrel fury and never quits on a play.

-    Energy sponge: Constantly snacking on dried fruit, nuts, or energy gel packs from his belt pouch.

-    Special teams wild card: Dangerous on punt returns when subbed in—bounces off tacklers like a pinball.

Nickname: “Little Wolf” (based on the Irish meaning of his name)

    Flair Patch: An acorn outline, symbolizing cleverness, persistence, and explosive potential

    Wears his standard gear on-field—but off-field, he’s often seen with his beloved tactical nut-belt (which the team endlessly teases him for)

    Twitchy, talkative, fiercely loyal

    Snack goblin—has probably hidden protein bits inside the stadium walls

    Will absolutely sacrifice his small body for a diving grab

Species: Unicorn (Polygonal Construct)
Position: Backup Quarterback (Hidden Depth)

Head: A blocky, low-poly 3D unicorn mask, faceted like a prism—gleams under stadium light
Jersey: Always appears with a jersey that reads "Hurricanes"—no one knows why, or whose it was
## Personality & Traits:

    Appears only in moments of absolute chaos—third string disaster strikes, and suddenly he’s warming up

    Speaks in riddles. Or code. Or possibly not at all.

    Throws with immaculate spiral, unreadable release, and strange curve logic

    Wears no helmet—only the polygonal unicorn mask, which no one can remove

    Seems to know the entire playbook, past, present, and future variations

    Rumors swirl that Coach Cian summoned him during a lightning storm using an encrypted Druid app

## On the Field:

    Perfect passer rating—but there are no official stats

    Wears number 17, but it never appears on team rosters

    Has a signature rollout move where the camera loses him for half a second

    Once reversed a fumble into a touchdown via “loopback motion”—even the refs were afraid to question it

    Jersey: Deep green Plateaus-style… but with another team’s name sewn into the seam

    Pants: White with gold-stitched spiral patterns—shimmer only in moonlight

    Cleats: Flat-black, hoof-shaped soles—leave behind no visible turf marks

    Wrist Tape: Wrapped on both wrists with faded ogham symbols traced in marker

        A mess of jumbled shoelaces, most frayed, some tied together

        A team-issued Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, unopened, stuffed behind a rag

        A tiny cooler labeled “DO NOT TOUCH (unless halftime)”—contents mysterious

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A gear surrounded by stars, sharp-stitched with reflective thread

        Quote scratched in jagged stylus lines:

            “It’s not broken. It’s just dramatically improvising.”

        Below that: a tally marked “field fixes without tools” – at least 27 and counting
## The Owners: Family Ted & The Italians

## 🕶️ THE OWNERS OF THE PLATEAUS
## 🧔 Family Ted

“Strategy is just grit in disguise.”
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always wears aviators indoors, regardless of weather or lighting

    Smells permanently of pipe smoke and barbecue sauce

    Dresses like your favorite uncle if he was also running covert ops from a golf course

    Owns 49% of the Plateaus, but insists it’s “a clean 51”

    Hair slicked back, voice like gravel on velvet

    Sometimes wears a “World’s Okayest Executive” hoodie that no one remembers printing

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    Mob consigliere energy + Sunday dad warmth + late-night conspiracy podcast host

    Believes the playbook should be carved into wood, not uploaded to “cloudspace”

    Has never once opened a spreadsheet

    Known to appear in the locker room post-win, lean against a doorway, and say:

        “That’s the kind of grit you can’t fake, boys.”

## 🗝️ Rumors & Legacy:

    May have once taken a penalty kick with a glass of bourbon in his other hand

    Has never been photographed with his mouth fully open

    Claims the stadium is built on “good ley lines”

    When players ask for contract bonuses, he offers cryptic riddles and brisket

## 🍝 The Italians

Three men. Three tracksuits. One unknowable force.
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always appear in a group of three

    Wear matching tracksuits in varying shades of navy blue, never labeled

    Never speak aloud—they just nod… and things happen

    One is always eating something:

        Olives, biscotti, prosciutto, or a peeled pear

    No one knows their names.

    No one knows where they’re from.

    They don’t know either.

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    The quiet engine room of Plateaus operations

    Appear randomly at practice, games, locker room corners—always just watching

    Never interfere, but somehow every stadium upgrade, locker repair, or glove shipment?

        “Handled by the Italians.”

    Sit in the owner’s booth at Tremethor Stadium—glass so dark it looks like a void

        Players sometimes say they feel watched… but comforted, somehow

## 🕰️ Rumors & Lore:

    One of them once adjusted a chinstrap, and the player never fumbled again

    Have been seen standing in the rain, unmoving, as if waiting for a storm to speak

    Jack’D has a photo of them in his equipment room, half-blurred like it glitched reality

    That photo is taped under the words:

        “Don’t ask.”

## 🔮 Collective Influence:

Family Ted brings the chaos and charm.
The Italians bring the silence and certainty.
Together, they own the Plateaus in spirit, deed… and probably ancient contract written in something that glows under moonlight.

Want a visual of them next? Maybe just… half-visible through the glass of that owner’s booth?
