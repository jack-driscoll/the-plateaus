## The Owners: Family Ted & The Italians

## 🕶️ THE OWNERS OF THE PLATEAUS
## 🧔 Family Ted

“Strategy is just grit in disguise.”
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always wears aviators indoors, regardless of weather or lighting

    Smells permanently of pipe smoke and barbecue sauce

    Dresses like your favorite uncle if he was also running covert ops from a golf course

    Owns 49% of the Plateaus, but insists it’s “a clean 51”

    Hair slicked back, voice like gravel on velvet

    Sometimes wears a “World’s Okayest Executive” hoodie that no one remembers printing

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    Mob consigliere energy + Sunday dad warmth + late-night conspiracy podcast host

    Believes the playbook should be carved into wood, not uploaded to “cloudspace”

    Has never once opened a spreadsheet

    Known to appear in the locker room post-win, lean against a doorway, and say:

        “That’s the kind of grit you can’t fake, boys.”

## 🗝️ Rumors & Legacy:

    May have once taken a penalty kick with a glass of bourbon in his other hand

    Has never been photographed with his mouth fully open

    Claims the stadium is built on “good ley lines”

    When players ask for contract bonuses, he offers cryptic riddles and brisket

## 🍝 The Italians

Three men. Three tracksuits. One unknowable force.
## 📸 Visual Profile:

    Always appear in a group of three

    Wear matching tracksuits in varying shades of navy blue, never labeled

    Never speak aloud—they just nod… and things happen

    One is always eating something:

        Olives, biscotti, prosciutto, or a peeled pear

    No one knows their names.

    No one knows where they’re from.

    They don’t know either.

## 🧥 Vibes & Behavior:

    The quiet engine room of Plateaus operations

    Appear randomly at practice, games, locker room corners—always just watching

    Never interfere, but somehow every stadium upgrade, locker repair, or glove shipment?

        “Handled by the Italians.”

    Sit in the owner’s booth at Tremethor Stadium—glass so dark it looks like a void

        Players sometimes say they feel watched… but comforted, somehow

## 🕰️ Rumors & Lore:

    One of them once adjusted a chinstrap, and the player never fumbled again

    Have been seen standing in the rain, unmoving, as if waiting for a storm to speak

    Jack’D has a photo of them in his equipment room, half-blurred like it glitched reality

    That photo is taped under the words:

        “Don’t ask.”

## 🔮 Collective Influence:

Family Ted brings the chaos and charm.
The Italians bring the silence and certainty.
Together, they own the Plateaus in spirit, deed… and probably ancient contract written in something that glows under moonlight.

Want a visual of them next? Maybe just… half-visible through the glass of that owner’s booth?
