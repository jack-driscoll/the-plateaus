# Caolán

## Caolán – #10 Overview

Species: Irish Hare (Anthropomorphic)
Position: Punter
Nickname: “The Moon Kicker” (sideline folklore—for now)
Height: 5'10"
Weight: 158 lbs
Fur: Silvery brown with sun-flecked tones, sleek but windblown
Eyes: Pale hazel with a flicker of lunar glow when he’s mid-punt
Expression: Quiet, unreadable, often distant—like he’s watching something only he can see
## Personality & Traits:

    Stoic and focused to the point of unnerving—teammates say he can meditate through a thunderstorm

    Speaks in riddles or oddly timed metaphors that somehow make sense later

    Known for uncanny awareness of wind, pressure, and distance—“He doesn't aim, he harmonizes”

    Often seen stretching in strange poses in the shadows or drawing spirals into turf

    Carries a deep spiritual aura, more shrine guardian than athlete

    Close with Lupa and Aidan—the mystics recognize their own

## On the Field:

    Signature Move: The Moon Drop—a perfectly timed, high-hanging punt that seems to disappear

    Once punted a ball so high during practice it vanished into the clouds.
    No one knows when it landed.

    Quietly competitive. Doesn’t chase glory—but will win field position wars with silence

    Team believes his kicks are predictive, not reactive

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #10, always tucked and perfectly aligned

    Pants: Standard white game pants, knee tape etched with thin chalk sigils

    Cleats: Narrow and meticulously maintained, often warmed before games

    Wrist tape: Faint symbols drawn in white chalk—washed off after every game

    Flair Patch: A crescent moon above a rabbit’s foot, symbolizing luck, rhythm, and ascension

## Quote:

    “Stillness has a sound. That’s why I'm around."

## Caolán’s Locker Layout

    Top Shelf:

        A small woven basket of dried clover and meadow grass, neatly bundled

        A tin of herbal salve labeled “For bruises & thoughts”

        A tiny journal with a green felt cover—filled with poems, dreams, and route sketches (never shown to anyone)

        A pine twig bound with a thread, possibly a good luck charm

        A folded strip of faded linen with a pressed flower inside

    Main Hook Area:

        His jersey (#10), hung loosely and slightly wrinkled

        Shoulder pads resting at an angle, one strap half undone

        Green helmet beneath (no visor), matte finish, lined with soft moss-like padding

        A small bundle of white wristbands, looped neatly over the hook

        A single blade of grass tucked behind the helmet earhole

        A feather tucked into a crack near the back wall

        A soft humming wind chime made of wood and twine, hanging from a carabiner

    Lower Compartment:

        A long, shallow box holding a few pebbles, some acorns, a sewing kit, and his leather notebook

        Backup gloves wrapped in a cloth napkin

        A half-empty water bottle with “H20” scribbled on the label in faded Sharpie

        A folded towel infused with lavender scent

        Vintage Bike #10 jockstrap, folded on the shelf under the towel

    Back Wall:

        Flair Patch: A crescent moon above a rabbit’s foot, stitched in muted white thread

        A quote drawn in looping white chalk:

            “Stillness has a sound, that’s why I’m around.”

        Three small dots and a spiral etched gently into the metal—aligned like constellations
