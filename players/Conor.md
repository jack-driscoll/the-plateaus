## Conor – #55

Species: Bear (Brown Bear)
Position: Middle Linebacker (MLB)
Height: 6'4"
Weight: 300 lbs
Build: Towering and broad with tree-trunk legs and linebacker eyes
Fur: Deep cinnamon brown with flecks of golden tan at the shoulders
Eyes: Soft brown off the field—locked and lethal on it
Expression: Easy smile, especially around rookies. Scowl activates only on Sundays.
## Personality & Traits:

    Known as the gentle giant off the field—helps the equipment staff, carries rookies’ gear without being asked

    Fiercely competitive on the field—snaps into attack mode the second the ball moves

    Deeply team-centered—knows everyone’s role, shouts adjustments even as he drops into coverage

    Surprisingly nimble—can twist through a pulling guard and still hit like a freight train

    Practices longer than anyone. Lifts before team lifts. Never forgets his towel.

## Uniform & Gear:

    Jersey: Plateaus green #55, always tucked, never taped

    Pants: White game pants, grass-stained permanently at the knees

    Gloves: Armored and slightly overbuilt—designed to absorb impact

    Cleats: Mid-cut for lateral stability, chewed up along the soles

    Flair Patch: A mountain with a heart inside—strength with compassion

## Aura on the Field:

    Sets the tone with the first hit—then follows it with a hand up

    Known to growl mid-play—especially when calling out counters

    Once tackled two blockers into their own QB and helped all three up

    Dáithí calls him “Coach Bear” behind his back. No one else dares.

## Quote:

    “If I hit you right, you’ll remember the kindness too.”
